France admitted Rafale jets were downed, with China adding that Chinese missiles were used to down them.

The US clarified that said missiles were fired from Chinese-made J-10s--and not US-made F-16s.

Numerous Kashmiri officials have confirmed 3 of the downings--those nearest to towns (per Reuters). An AP photographer was present at one of the sites.

When cross-referenced with the crash site data published by Pakistan--which included electronic signatures--we see that the 3 jets in question were  1) a Rafale, 2) a MiG-29, and 3) a Su-30.

So we know two Russian-made jets were downed, along with multiple Rafales.

India are considered hostile and aggressive for launching the attack on PAK first despite PAK has accepted third party to conduct a transparent investigation regarding the terrorist tragedy. India's motive is clear part.. not important about terrorist.. pure intentions is to use this terrorist tragedy as an excuse to launch a full scale war with PAK and to cut off water to PAK. Pure bullying... Their military option had backfired themselves... Indian self claim that their war launch against PAK they fighting terrorism.. Indians are the saviours of mankind and are now blaming the world and UN for not supporting India... One point I had observe.. whenever or whoever view is against India.. they will connect that country or individual as terrorist. They self claim or labeled their opponents as terrorist and under the disguise of anti terrorist as excuse for India to wage war or to harm the individual. UN should take actions against India for violating the water threats India is imposing on PAK... UN should also pursue India military for targeting PAK civilians in this conflict and their atrocities againest minority race in India. UN and other countries should also reject India's application on loans should attempt to.. it is obvious India's future loan are not use on developing the country for the good of their people but to fund their geopolitical hostile ambitions. India had openly support and defended Israel's atrocities using terrorism as an excuse. So far China and turkey are the ones that boldly step up providing nessesary military aid to PAK to repel India's aggression and upholding the security in the region.

Pakistan successfully withstood a major Indian offensive and scored some vital military and diplomatic victories. India, on the other hand, has very little to show for its gambit.

We had immense damage on our infrastructure and according to evidence by third parties damage was done at 3 hangers, 2 runways and few buildings in our Air bases. 
Where we won was the people of Pakistan on social media,  our tolerance, call for peace and basic humanity.  Even if there were fake reports ,general population shutdown fake videos, war mongering and criticized radical extremist behavior.  
Indian people showed their real face to the world calling for genocide, citing with Israel.  That's where India lost. In humanity and toxic racist behavior made nuetral people question their mental state.
