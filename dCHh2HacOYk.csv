G'day,

Look in the Mirror.

If you do not share your spare food, then when you are hungry, who will share theirs with you ?

Clearly, you are a Feral Human, camping on Land your Ancestors stole after they ran away from the Food-Desert they managed to manufacture on their own
Homeland...

The wild unfenced Kangaroos and Wallabies and Possums which visit me to share my spare Food, only expect one slice of Bread and a Biscuit each, per day...; they come, knock, wait, eat, and go on with their day.

Sharing is caring.

One feels oneself  to be a slightly more pleasant person,
Afterwards...., and if the local Wildlife doesn't trust one - then what sort of a Scumbag looks back from one's Mirror...?

Such is life.

Have a good one.

Stay safe.

US now impose 30% instead of 145% tariffs on China products with US importers adding 30% of extra cost that will be pass down to the consumers as a form of levy or taxes collected on behalf of the US government.
Instead of 145%, the US impose 30% as a form of levy onto US consumers to raise US government revenue.
Chinese companies are selling their products or services to US companies or other businesses at wholesale prices to US importers before it reaches the end consumer.
It is primarily focused on covering production costs and ensuring a profit margin, rather than including additional costs like marketing and sales that are part of retail pricing.
Wholesale pricing aims for low cost and high volume, targeting bulk buyers, resellers, and businesses.
US companies and retailers then mark up 30% of the wholesale price for US government plus their profits before the final sale to consumers.
US is deceiving the US consumers that China is paying for the tariffs of 30% of the imported China products to the US instead of the US consumers.
The average profit margin for Chinese manufacturers appears to be relatively low, ranging from 3% to 7%.

UgxAmeV0w1BxY5uxKJB4AaABAg.AIHUH3o6ShIAIHi28VeNDo,"¬†@scarletspider1240¬† The average markup at Walmart for any of the items they sell is 24%.......that gives them a profit margin of  19.3548%.   Most people tend to confuse mark up for pofit.

Lets say that Walmart buys an item for USD100 and marks it up 24%, meaning they sell it to you the consumer atUSD124, making them USD24 in actual profit and a 19.3549%

If they eat the 30% tariff, they will be paying USD130 for an item they can only sell at USD124, making a USD6 loss on that item which puts their profim margin into negative numbers, at -4.8387.

But here's the kicker, by passing on the tariff cost to you, Walmart actualy makes more money per item.

Again, lets use are hypothetical USD100 Walmart pays for an item from China, with the 30% tariff, the landed cost of that item is now USD130, factor in the 24% markup Walmart charges, the price to the consumer is now USD161.20, making Walmart USD31.20 in profit, or and extra USD7.2 per item but their actual profit margin remains the same.

Basically, if an item is something people use or need on a regular basis, they will pay the extra after grumbling about it and soon will just accept the more expensive price as normal.   Because of this, firms such as Walmart really don't mind tariffs as long as they are too steep or scare off their customers.   The may lose a few sales, but will more than make up for it with the additional profit made per item.

In fact they can actually profit quite hansonly from them in the right circumstances.   A 30% tariff migh be acceptable, but that silly 145% tariffs sure as hell wasn't/",@gumpyoldbugger6944,0,1747615980,True,UgxAmeV0w1BxY5uxKJB4AaABAg
