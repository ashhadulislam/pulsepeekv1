  "summary": "The comment section is highly polarized and emotionally charged, with a significant focus on the Kashmir conflict, Hindu-Muslim relations, and criticism of the Modi government. There's a strong presence of negative sentiment, driven by reports of human rights violations and media bias. The comments reflect deep divisions within Indian society, with many expressing fear, anger, and sadness over the current situation. Despite the negativity, there are also messages of hope and solidarity with Kashmiris and other oppressed groups. The high controversy score indicates a volatile discussion, with a notable amount of toxicity and a few instances of sarcasm and spam.",
