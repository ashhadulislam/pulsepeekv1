  "summary": "The comment section is highly polarized, with a strong presence of sarcasm and criticism directed towards Pakistan's military claims and actions. There's a notable emphasis on the superiority of Indian military technology and skepticism towards Pakistan's counterclaims. The discussion also touches on broader geopolitical issues, including terrorism and the role of social media in spreading misinformation. The tone is largely negative, with a significant amount of toxicity, reflecting deep-seated tensions between the two nations.",
