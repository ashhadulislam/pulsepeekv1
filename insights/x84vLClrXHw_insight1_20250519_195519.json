There's a significant amount of toxicity, with comments mocking Hindu beliefs and expressing support for Muslim causes, especially in Kashmir and Palestine. The discussion reflects deep-seated religious and political tensions, with frequent mentions of 'Hindu vs Muslim' conflicts and criticism of Indian policies.
