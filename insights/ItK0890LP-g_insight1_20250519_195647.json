  "summary": "The comment section is overwhelmingly positive towards Turkey and Pakistan, showcasing strong feelings of brotherhood and unity among Muslim countries. There's a significant amount of national pride and joy, especially in the context of Turkey and Pakistan's relationship. However, there's also a notable presence of negative sentiment and sarcasm directed towards India, reflecting a polarized and controversial discussion. The comments suggest a deep-seated rivalry and tension between India and Pakistan, with Turkey and other Muslim countries being seen as allies. The high controversy score indicates that the topic is highly divisive, with a mix of supportive and toxic comments.",
