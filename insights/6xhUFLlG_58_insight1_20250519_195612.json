  "summary": "The comment section is highly polarized and emotionally charged, with a strong sense of solidarity among Muslims against perceived injustices by the Indian government. There is significant anger and defiance, particularly in relation to the India-Pakistan conflict, censorship, and human rights violations in Kashmir. The high controversy score and toxic comment count indicate a deeply divisive topic, with comments reflecting a wide range of emotions from solidarity to outright hostility. The presence of multiple languages and the mention of various countries highlight the international interest and concern over the issues discussed.",
