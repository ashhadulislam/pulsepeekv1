  "polarizing_comment": "After 1400 years, the Arab world—once the cradle of divine revelation—seems to have fallen back into the shadows of ignorance. The UAE, a nation built on the legacy of Islam, now rolls out the red carpet for those who mock our faith and oppress our brothers and sisters. As Gaza bleeds, silence reigns. As modesty fades, and women unveil what Islam asked to guard, the essence of our deen is being forgotten. This is not the Islam of the Prophet ﷺ. This is not the path of justice, dignity, or compassion. Hearts have hardened, and eyes have turned away — and that is the true tragedy of our time.",
  "balanced_response": "Every era has its challenges, but Islam's essence remains in the hearts of the faithful, not just in traditions. The UAE's progress doesn't erase individual faith."
