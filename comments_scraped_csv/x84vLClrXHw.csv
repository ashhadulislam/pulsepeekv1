In the Sri Lankan case, a Buddhist monk, Ayagama Samitha, and his driver were allegedly attacked by Muslims in Dharga Town, sparking mob violence against Muslim businesses—similar to what’s happening in Kashmir now.

Buddhist figures like Yana Sara were reportedly used to spread false narratives, just as religious figures in India are being used today to incite communal tensions. Media outlets like Hiru TV in Sri Lanka played a role in amplifying this misinformation—again, a parallel to how some Indian media outlets operate today.

Shockingly, it was later revealed that the individuals accused of being Muslims in the Sri Lankan incident weren’t even Muslim. There’s a documentary about this case that uncovers these truths. At the time, Rajapaksa, who was close to Modi, was in power. There are claims that similar strategies were used to justify violence, including church bo*bings blamed on Muslims, all contributing to the 2022 riots.

Alright, let’s clear this up.

First off, the claim that “millions of Muslims” were massacred in Kashmir is just not true. There’s no proof for that — not from the UN, not from Amnesty, not even from pro-Pakistan sources. The total number of deaths in the conflict (including civilians, militants, and soldiers) is estimated around 50,000–100,000 since the late ’80s — tragic, yes, but nowhere near “millions.” That’s just propaganda.

Now, about the Kashmiri Pandits — they were ethnically cleansed from the valley in 1990. Thousands were threatened, hundreds were murdered, and around 350,000 Hindus were forced to flee. Their homes were looted, temples destroyed, and they’ve lived as refugees in their own country ever since. So saying “here we go again” about that is really messed up — it’s like telling Holocaust survivors to stop complaining. Not cool.

And by the way, talking about one community’s pain doesn’t mean ignoring another’s. Yes, innocent Muslims have also suffered in the conflict — that should be acknowledged too. But using their suffering to shut down discussion of the Pandit genocide is just wrong.

Also, let’s not forget the conflict started because of an armed Islamist insurgency — funded and trained from across the border. The violence didn’t just appear out of nowhere, and the first people targeted were the Kashmiri Hindus.

So yeah, both sides have pain. But don’t erase or mock one group’s trauma just to make a political point.",@Dasaanudasa108,1,1746489600,True,UgzDBHn8Miab16ih5h14AaABAg

Islam spread through war, breeding like rabbits, tax pressure, and political deals—let’s not pretend it was all hugs and invitations. Meanwhile, Vedic thought was never about forcing anyone. That’s why Arabs, Greeks, Persians, and even Chinese monks came to India—not to convert us, but to study our sciences, math, and spiritual teachings. South India especially was a huge trade and knowledge hub. Even the so-called Islamic “Golden Age” in Baghdad got most of its philosophy, medicine, and astronomy by translating works from India and Greece. Vedic culture gave the world zero, yoga, deep spiritual ideas like karma and reincarnation, and bhakti—loving devotion to the Divine. Hinduism doesn’t grow by threats or breeding contests; it grows because it speaks to the soul.

Imagine pitching that at a UN peace summit:

“Ladies and gentlemen, we come in peace. Except the Jews and the Hindus—they’re naturally hostile to us, says our holy book. But otherwise, total harmony!”

👏 Round of applause for unity, everyone.

And let’s talk about irony. Muslims reciting this verse while:
	•	Doing hajj in Saudi Arabia where Muslims kill other Muslims over minor doctrinal disputes,
	•	Or while burning Shia mosques,
	•	Or while fighting over who gets to define Islam properly in every other Muslim-majority country…

But yeah, sure—it’s the Hindus and Jews who are the real problem. Not the fact that your own scholars can’t even agree on who a “real Muslim” is.

And here’s the kicker:
Hindus literally believe everyone is divine, welcome you to festivals, feed you vegan sweets, and bow to cows. But the Qur’an says they hate you?

Meanwhile, you say “Allahu Akbar” and blow up an ancient Buddha statue or a temple and still claim moral high ground.

It is generally believed to have originated around 1500 BCE (or even earlier), with the Vedic period, when the Vedas—the oldest Hindu scriptures—were composed.

However, elements of Hinduism can be traced even further back to the Indus Valley Civilization (around 2500–1500 BCE), suggesting that the religion could be over 4,000 years old. Unlike many other religions, Hinduism has no single founder and evolved gradually through a fusion of various cultural and spiritual traditions of ancient India.

In 2019, Imran Khan had to practically bully the airforce to respond. Fortunately, despite the western world blowing gass up thier asses, hindus are flatly too incompetent to win if it comes to blows. They were nice an quiet since then.

Now, with the american regime change, we have the a cadre of literal jailbirds that spent the last 2 years looting every cash reserve, every food storage, annihilated the refurbishment of and anything else a population. Oh also, the army staff bought espensive gas, and sold most of the ammo on america's say-so. 

The plan is to just do what they did last time, since there's no minimal opposition apparent to send the hindu's scurrying away this time. 

This time it actually WILL be a war and its really only up to the local population to fight off the hindu scum AND the traitor army - whos more likely to support the invaders - by themselves.
