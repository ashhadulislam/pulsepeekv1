What happened here was nothing but a staged drama. India orchestrated the incident and blamed Pakistan for it.
The killing of tourists in Pahalgam had no support from Kashmiris. It was a brutal and shameful act, and whoever committed it does not represent us.
One brave Kashmiri even lost his life trying to protect the tourists and stop the attackers.
Yet, Godi media twisted the story, fueling hatred and portraying Kashmiris as terrorists.
Today, even Kashmiris living outside of Kashmir are not safe in India ‚Äî they are being tortured and harassed.
Two innocent Kashmiris were killed and wrongly labeled as terrorists, even though they were just ordinary locals.
After the Pahalgam incident, over 2,000 Kashmiris were thrown into jails without justice.

Likewise India also has a history unique to it separate from Pakistan throughout history except during during a blip of the british occupation and Mughal rule prior to that for millenia India was its own unique separate nation belonging only to present day Indians‚ù§

Pakistan and Kashmir is an ancient nation which was previously under a different name, but it has existed as its own separate entity for millenia like India.

Ugwl1_oi1kxcTmEY92V4AaABAg,"The Indus River originates in Tibet (China), enters Ladakh (India) for a short stretch, and then flows into Pakistan.
India only has control over a small part of the Indus‚Äôs flow.
To stop the river, India would need massive infrastructure (like huge dams or diversions) on a tough mountainous terrain ‚Äî and even then, it would only affect a small part of the total Indus water.
Blocking a major river would be seen internationally as an act of aggression (even an act of war, in extreme interpretations).
China (which controls the Indus‚Äôs source) might also react ‚Äî and India would face huge diplomatic backlash from not just Pakistan, but many other countries (including Western powers, Muslim nations, etc.).
The Indus flows through high-altitude, remote, mountainous regions (Ladakh, near Tibet border).
Building a massive dam or blockade there would be extremely difficult because:
It's very cold, rocky, and unstable (earthquake-prone zone).
Logistics (moving huge amounts of material and machinery) would be a nightmare.
Military risks are high ‚Äî the area is near the India-China-Pakistan border (a very sensitive, militarized zone).
Even a small hydropower dam (like Kishanganga) took India decades to complete.
Pakistan would immediately:
Go to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or World Bank Arbitration.
Claim that India is waging ""water war"", gaining sympathy from many countries (even India‚Äôs allies might criticize India).
Maybe even escalate militarily.

The world would pressure India hard to stop ‚Äî nobody wants rivers to be used as weapons.
To completely stop the Indus, India would need to build huge dams or tunnels to store or redirect the river.
These dams would:
Take decades to plan and build.
Cost billions of dollars.
Still have the risk of failure because of floods, earthquakes, or sabotage.
Also, remember: Indus River has a huge volume of water ‚Äî it's one of the largest rivers in the world by flow.

There are two types who came together and this is why hindu idiology fits well with the Zionist idiology.

Who Are Hindu Aryans? The ancient Aryans were a group of people who spread into northern India, bringing with them India's caste system of hierarchical classes and the Vedic religion that shaped modern Hinduism.

Zionist-Aryanism is an ideology of German racial supremacy which views the supposed Aryan race as a distinct and superior racial group which is entitled to rule the rest of humanity.

I want to say that you should have condemned killing of innocents especially when Islam was used as an excuse to kill innocent Hindus.

While I agree that godi media tries to bring Muslim hatred among general Hindu public by showing selective and twisted news and hiding the wrongdoings happening on Muslims and only highlighting those done by Muslims.

But you on the other hand mostly show incidents from India only when Hindus do something wrong. Which is same as Godi media, just in the opposite way.
In this way hatred may be  propagated against innocent Hindus in the minds of Muslims.

As a true Muslim, it is your duty to be fair and just and show both sides and not do the same mistake.
By making videos and pointing out on What Muslims are doing wrong, you can also work for the betterment of Muslims by educating them on how to be a better human  and how to avoid wrongdoings on people of other religions too.

 advocating Hindutva in India have urged the expulsion of all Kashmiris from Mainland India following an assault on tourists in Pahalgam, Kashmir.

West Bengal BJP leader Shubhendu Adhikari remarked, 'He desires the dead bodies of 260 jihadis.' However, among the 26 fatalities, there was Kashmiri Muslim Syed Hussain Shah. This indicates that these Hindu leaders are exploiting the Pahalgam event, particularly targeting Kashmiri Muslims. Is it justifiable to hold all Muslims accountable for this attack solely because the Kashmiri insurgents are Muslims? Over the past two days, we have observed numerous social media posts illustrating how local Kashmiri Muslims have endeavored to assist or protect tourists. Syed Hussain Shah fell victim to gunfire from rebels while attempting to aid some Hindu tourists. The BJP and Hindutva-aligned parties appear intent on targeting minority Muslims at any opportunity.

Prophet Muhammad S.A.W said if u can recite Salatul Tasbih once in your life time,u should cause ut has great rewards 
Also learn and recite Sayyadul iftighar  once in Fajr and once in Maghrub sincerely,it forguves all sins as its best was to ask for forgiveness, its very short pls guys if u d!‚Ç¨ before maghrib after reading it in Fajr its counted as shahadt and vice versa plsss üò¢",@reminder_for_you-2,0,1746489600,True,UgzgI5WpRI1KKqzk-A94AaABAg
UgzgI5WpRI1KKqzk-A94AaABAg.AHVxILvEAMNAHW7jsAk64p,"Walaikum Assalam brother,I'm not a shiekh but a fellow Muslim. Here's a few tips:
-Understand what u say in Salah and the benefits of it like when u say Allah u Akbar,u declare Allah is greater than everything ,your problems everything
An example is Surah Fatiha,this world is a delusion of Happiness and Paryer grounds u. God is all knowing,ask Allah for help sincerely and he always responds no matter what, * Allah said he is closer than our jugular vein* the vein from the neck,connected straight to the heart
-Ask Allah for help and to grant u sweetness of prayer
-Whenever u sin pray,whenever u hear a good news say Alhamdullilah and pray. There is no sin u do that will not stop or lessen if u do this. Ask Allah for help and try again and repent immediately no matter billions of times. Allah knows u well and gave u the capacity yourself according to which you'll be judged.
-Your sins and worries fall off when u bow,u are talking to the creator of the Universe. The Supreme handler of all affairs,trust him.
-Angels always pray with u,left and right. Angels the size of mountains pray behind you. 
- Angels pray for mercy upon u until u leave prayer mat
- Do small Dhikr like Ayat ul kursi after every fard prayer ,its guarentee paradise.
- Say Subhan Allah 10x,Alhamdullilah 10x,AllahuAkbar 10x after fard prayer
- Say Surah Ikhlass 10x after fard prayer
- Say Subhan Allahi Wabihamdihi Adada Khalqihi Wa rida nafsihi Wa zina'ata Arshihi wa mid'ada khalqihi. This is better than general Dhikr
- Make kalimah your instant response. Like imagine getting a sudden death where u get into car crash God Forbid,u say the f-word. U meet God doing the action u died upon . Imagine if it was La ilaha illal lah Muhammadur RasulAllah instead. 
-Imagine Kaabah infront of you
- The number of times u pray,the easier it will be on Day of Judgement to stand before your lord
-Prayer will protect u from punishment of grave
- I think a door of Jannah is called Baab e Salat too
- Last words and advices of Prophet Muhammad S.A.W contained words like Don't leave the prayer 3 times. 
- Prayer is said to be the difference between Muslim and non Muslim
- It was given on Miraj journey as a gift. Not praying is the punishment. True happiness lies with the maker. Prophet Muhammad S.A.W used to run like a lion for salah. Every drip of water of wuzu,every step towards prayer counts. How easy is Islam
- Start small and slowly bring your way up,don't overwhelm. You asked ,that's a great sign of belief and u are asking for help and Alhamdullilah I'm honoured Allah chose me as one of the ways to guve it to you. He put that thought in u for a reason.
- Cry your heart out in sujood. Make dua,talk to Allah in sujud,throughout the day and in duas. Duas can be said everywhere and anytime. 
-Remeber Allah often and thank him for everything,he knows better and loves u the most. Allah will be as u perceive him to be.
- Make dua as u are comfortable with and in any language even when no words are spoken. 
- Send Salawat upon Prophet Muhammad S.A.W then Praise Allah,call upon his blessed names,make your dua,end with praise and salawat and then say Ameen. (Prophet Yunus A.s. dua is very powrful and u can say ut through oyt and before saying Ameen. No muslim who says this his dua is keft unaswered (la ilahaillaantasubhan'akainnikuntuminaz zalimeen Ameen))
- Try to build connection with Allah.
- Don't rush prayer,think about other stuff nor look here and there. 
-Take full time and make sure u understand and pray with your heart not just to get it over with. Take times until your muscles and heart is at rest
- Even if u don't feel that connection,pray and ask Allah for it. Maybe the prayer u forced yourself to pray just out of sheer faith and connection to Allah which u didn't wanna loose and u know Allah will like this, is the most beloved prayer. Never skip a prayer. If u have too many skipped,say sincere tawbah and don't miss another and try to make up as many as u can. Some scholars say u have to make up all but some say say proper istighfar and repentance and then try to never miss them and make as many as u can. Extra prayer so extra reward.
-  Try research about Islam and read Divine Qur'an, even the meaning ot just listen Surah Mulk before Bed ad Surah Kahf on Friday. Smallest effort matters. Try do something new everyday. Maybe even 5 mins",@reminder_for_you-2,0,1746489600,True,UgzgI5WpRI1KKqzk-A94AaABAg

Islam mein gumaan (yaani kisi ke baare mein andaza lagana ya shak karna) ke mamle mein kaafi saaf hidayat di gayi hai.

Qur'an mein Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12) mein Allah ta'ala farmate hain:

> ""Ey logon jo imaan laye ho! Bohot zyada gumaan se bacho, kyunki kuch gumaan gunaah hota hai. Aur tajassus (taftish/jasoosi) na karo, aur tum mein se koi doosre ki gheebat na kare...""



Is ayat ka matlab yeh hai ki:

Har waqt shak karna, andazey lagana theek nahi hai.

Har gumaan burai nahi hota, lekin zyadatar gumaan gunaah ki taraf le jaata hai.

Musalmaan ko chahiye ke husn-e-zann (achha gumaan) rakhe doosron ke liye, jab tak koi clear saboot na ho.


Hadees mein bhi Prophet Muhammad (Ô∑∫) ne firmaya:

> ""Gumaan sabse jhooti baat hai."" (Bukhari aur Muslim ki riwayat)



Simple shabdon mein:

Islam mein bure gumaan ki manaahi hai.

Achha gumaan rakhna pasandida hai.

Tajassus (taftishi soch ya chhup kar jaanna) aur gheebat (peechhe burai) karna strictly mana hai.
Ps
(This is chat gpt. Woh toh maine ek baar khutbe mein suna tha toh soch thoda disputed ho sakta hai is liye chat gpt sey confirm karwa lliya)     So yeah aap mere baare mein  gumaan kar rahe hai. + I know ki India mein Kashmiri Muslims (Muslims) in general ke sath kuchh jagaho par discrimination hota hai magar it doesn't mean ki har jagah hota hai. I have seen discrimination on the basis of religion (faced too) , but is a different story and Kashmir not being a part of India is a different story.

Jihad al-Nafs (struggle against one‚Äôs own soul to avoid sin),

Jihad bil-‚ÄòIlm (struggle through knowledge and education),

Jihad bil-Mal (struggle through wealth by supporting good causes),

Jihad bil-Sayf (struggle through fighting, only when necessary to defend against oppression).
The highest form of jihad is striving to improve oneself and society according to Allah‚Äôs guidance.

In Islam, fighting is only allowed against those who attack you first. Killing innocent people is strictly forbidden and is not considered jihad. True jihad never includes harming innocent lives.",@AyeshaNoor-tc9me,0,1745884800,True,UgxuWVS8wijPDB10Bwh4AaABAg
