Yes, Pakistan has gone to the IMF, but so has India — 7 times, including in 1991 when India’s foreign reserves were so low they had to airlift gold to secure a bailout. Economic ups and downs are part of global capitalism — even the US and UK have taken IMF support historically.

Also, China is India’s biggest trading partner, and India imports more from China than it exports, even after public statements against Chinese products. So before pointing fingers at who’s “hiding behind” whom, look at your own economic dependencies.

Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, ""When is the help of Allāh?"" Unquestionably, the help of Allāh is near.
(Surah Baqarah)

Quran Says:
Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead—in fact, they are alive! But you do not perceive it.

Quran reveals:
We do not fight others by virtue of troops, military gear or multitudes. We fight them by virtue of this religion with which Allah The Almighty honored us. Proceed and it will be one of two things, either gaining victory or martyrdom.""",@faryaltariq9314,7,1747008000,False,

Scene: A quiet rural village in Pakistan. Afternoon. Aunty is pouring tea on the porch. A goat is chewing on someone’s socks.

Aunty (looking up at the sky):
Hey Rashid, what’s that thing flying up there? That’s no pigeon!

Uncle (adjusting his old cricket cap, squinting):
Pigeon? That’s one of those fancy Indian drones! Probably Israeli-made too... double trouble!

Aunty (concerned):
What? Indian and Israeli? That’s like mixing vodka with Red Bull!

Uncle (suddenly serious):
Enough is enough. Bring me the shotgun my grandfather used to fight the British. The old double-barrel one hanging above the fridge.

Aunty (alarmed):
That rusty thing? You use it to scare off the cows!

Uncle (marching out dramatically):
Today, it scares off imperialism.

[Cut to: Uncle in the middle of the field, in sandals and a checkered shawl, wind blowing dramatically like a Bollywood war film.]

Uncle (gritting his teeth):
For the homeland. For honor. For the last piece of naan.

[BOOM! Shotgun goes off. There’s a pause, then a sputter and a loud CRASH nearby.]

Aunty (peeking out from behind the door):
Did you hit it?

[Uncle reappears, proudly dragging the downed drone behind him like a hunting trophy.]

Within minutes, India accused Pakistan of carrying out the attack. This felt like a premature and highly politicized accusation.

I understand that anything is possible, and there are many perspectives to consider. However, we may never know the full truth because India did not conduct a thorough investigation with neutral international observers, such as the United Nations.

If a neutral investigation had taken place and it was proven that Pakistani nationals were involved, I believe Pakistan would have taken action against the responsible group, as they have expressed a willingness to cooperate with India in such cases.

Every nation has a responsibility to do everything in its power to prevent such tragedies. In Kashmir, the Muslim population should not be oppressed by the Indian military. They deserve freedom of speech, freedom of movement, and a genuine sense of inclusion within India.

I also notice a troubling pattern of hostility from India toward Pakistan—jumping to conclusions and assigning blame without due process. This is a dangerous and unhealthy mindset.

We should look to Europe, where countries came together after World War II. Similarly, India and Pakistan need to move past conflict and work toward peace. This includes rejecting extremist or far-right politics, such as those promoted by the BJP, which often fuel division.

Ugyz7tQMdgMExEhHBhB4AaABAg.AHy23taERdSAHyAVk-fCi7," @Moody.Smiruai  Your view oversimplifies the situation. While it's true that some Kashmiris supported Pakistan, the decision to accede to India was made by the Maharaja after a Pakistani-backed invasion, which put his state at risk. The Instrument of Accession was signed legally, and India intervened only after this, which is why it is not an ‘occupation.’

Regarding the violence, there were Kashmiris on both sides those who resisted the Maharaja's rule and those who supported his decision to accede to India. The tribal militias were not there to help Kashmiris but to forcefully annex the region for Pakistan. This conflict resulted in widespread suffering for the people of Kashmir, regardless of their allegiance.

As for your claim about the ‘unsteady hold’ the borders reflect an ongoing dispute, not an unstable legal claim. India’s sovereignty over Kashmir comes from the Instrument of Accession, which was a legitimate act under international law, despite the ongoing dispute.""",@zain_muzzammil,0,1747008000,True,Ugyz7tQMdgMExEhHBhB4AaABAg
Ugyz7tQMdgMExEhHBhB4AaABAg.AHy23taERdSAHy5csYjFQZ," @ashaqhussain6902  I am not part of any Hindutva group, and in fact, I’m Hyderabadi. The history of Kashmir’s accession is nuanced. While it's true that Gulab Singh bought Kashmir from the British in 1846, the Maharaja’s decision to accede to India in 1947 came after a tribal invasion backed by Pakistan, and was legally made through the Instrument of Accession. While UN resolutions called for a plebiscite, it was contingent on both sides adhering to the terms, including Pakistan’s withdrawal of forces, which didn’t happen.

Comparing Kashmir to Hyderabad isn’t entirely accurate the Nizam’s situation was different. Hari Singh’s decision wasn’t about ‘selling out’ the people but was made under a direct threat to the state. It’s important to approach this issue with all facts in mind, rather than selective historical narratives.",@zain_muzzammil,0,1747008000,True,Ugyz7tQMdgMExEhHBhB4AaABAg
Ugyz7tQMdgMExEhHBhB4AaABAg,"Kashmir was never 'occupied' by India. Historically, it has been an integral part of the Indian subcontinent, including during the Mughal Empire, which ruled the region from 1586 to the mid-1700s. After that, it came under Afghan, Sikh, and then Dogra rule. In 1947, when British India was partitioned, princely states had the choice to join either India or Pakistan. The Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir, Hari Singh, legally signed the Instrument of Accession to India on October 26, 1947, after Pakistani tribal militias invaded the region. This made Kashmir a legal part of India under international law. The Indian Army was airlifted in only after the accession was signed. So, there is no question of 'occupation'—it was a defensive response to external aggression, and the accession was legitimate. That’s the historical and legal reality, whether one likes it or not. And no, you can’t compare this to Israel. Kashmir was not claimed as any 'promised land' based on religious prophecy. It was a princely state that lawfully joined a democratic nation.

Not to mention Indias decades of simple persecution of Muslims in their own country , and Kashmir being the most militarized area in the world suppressing Kashmiris.

If you are a Muslim , know that Islam is generally anti-nationalist. Pakistan's Government aint great but compared to the Hindutva pile of garbage known as the Indian Government? Miles better. Doesn't matter where you're from , if you are a Muslim from anywhere this isn't up for discussion.

Genre: Action / Patriotism / Mythic Vedic Sci-Fi Thriller

Logline:
When global conspiracies threaten Bharat Mata's honour, India unleashes its most powerful assets: Palki Sharma, Arnab Goswami, and an elite commando unit trained in Vedic warfare and WhatsApp-certified tactics, in a mission so daring, it’s classified under Agni-level anger.


---

Plot Summary:

The world is laughing. Western media claims India lost 5 aircraft. One was ""allegedly"" downed by a PL-15 missile, two by turbulence, and the last two by friendly fire (""Fake news!""). But in the studios of Bharat News HQ, Arnab Goswami is not having it. His face tightens. His jaw clenches. His hair lifts slightly from sheer rage. He bellows:
“THE NATION WANTS TO KNOW—WHERE ARE THE RAFAL-ES??”

Meanwhile, Palki Sharma uncovers ancient Sanskrit scrolls written in invisible ink under a Shiva statue in Paris, revealing that India’s lost jets are not destroyed — they’ve been cloaked in Vedic stealth mode, orbiting silently in another realm.

Enter: RAW’s elite team, codename: Team Sindoor. Armed with coconut-grenade launchers, lemon-powered drones, and cow-milk-fueled jetpacks, they ride Tejas MkInfinity jets (now coated with Guamutronium™) into Pakistani airspace... and beyond.

Arnab is inserted into the battlefield—screaming so loudly that enemy radar stations explode from the resonance.
Palki delivers precision facts while live-commentating in 4K Sanskrit.
A secret Israeli ally drops samosas and Intel from space.


---

Final Battle:
As Tejas squadrons strike fear with Hanuman Chakras, the enemy fires 5 more missiles. But our brave pilots, trained in “Ramming Missile Yoga”, dive straight into them—sacrificing planes to destroy the weapons mid-air.
“THIS IS VEDIC WARFARE, BABY!”

Climax:
Arnab hijacks the enemy broadcast and shouts, “WE HAVE TAKEN RAWALPINDI! STOP BREATHING FAKE NEWS!”
The screen shatters.

Operation complete. The nation cheers.

Several countries and international bodies have condemned Israel's actions in Gaza, with some implementing diplomatic measures, sanctions, or legal actions in response to violations of international law:

🌍 Diplomatic Condemnations and Actions

🇪🇺 European Union and Member States

The EU has intensified its criticism of Israel's military operations in Gaza, particularly concerning the blockade of humanitarian aid and plans for permanent occupation.  Countries like France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium have urged Israel to adhere to international law and allow humanitarian access.  The Netherlands has proposed reviewing the EU-Israel Association Agreement due to potential human rights violations.  


🇨🇴 Colombia

In May 2024, Colombia severed diplomatic relations with Israel over its conduct in Gaza, citing the ""massacre of Palestinian people.""  President Gustavo Petro compared Israel's actions to Nazi Germany and emphasized the need for a two-state solution.  


🇧🇴 Bolivia

Bolivia cut diplomatic ties with Israel in October 2023, accusing it of committing ""crimes against humanity"" in Gaza.  This move was part of a broader condemnation by Latin American countries.  


🇿🇦 South Africa

South Africa recalled its diplomats from Israel, citing the Israeli government's refusal to respect international law and its ""genocidal airstrikes"" against Palestinians. It initiated a legal case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).


🛑 Sanctions and Arms Embargoes

🇪🇸 Spain

Spain announced a ban on ships carrying weapons to Israel from docking at its ports and confirmed it had not sold arms to Israel since October 2023.  


🇨🇦 Canada

Canada's parliament agreed in a non-binding vote to halt future military sales to Israel, with the foreign affairs minister confirming that arms shipments would stop.  


🇧🇪 Belgium

Belgium's Wallonia region suspended licenses for exporting munitions to Israel following concerns over violations of international humanitarian law.  


🇳🇱 Netherlands

A Dutch court ordered the government to stop supplying F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel due to the risk of serious violations of international humanitarian law.  


🇯🇵 Japan

Japan suspended arms sales to Israel, and the Japanese company Itochu Corporation ended its partnership with Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems.  

⚖️ Legal Actions and International Proceedings

🇨🇱 Chile

Chile requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Israel's actions in Gaza and the occupied territories.  


🇧🇪 Belgium

Belgium has campaigned for an EU-wide ban on arms sales to Israel and has expressed strong criticism of Israeli bombings in Gaza.",@moizahmed4705,0,1747008000,True,UgxLfsWj6ymMKx0yluh4AaABAg

The recent Pahalgam incident was immediately politicized and used as an excuse by India to launch cross-border attacks—again targeting Pakistan without conclusive evidence or proper investigation. This isn’t new; India has a pattern of blaming Pakistan before facts are verified, just to justify aggression.

Pakistan, on the other hand, has shown restraint and consistently emphasized peace, targeting only military installations when forced to respond—never civilian areas. Even during Operation Swift Retort, Pakistan avoided casualties and demonstrated precision. Meanwhile, India has been accused of targeting villages, mosques, and civilian areas in AJK, Bahawalpur, sialkot, lahore, and some other cities, resulting in deaths of innocent women and children include one 6 year old innocent girl—then shamefully labeling them as ""terrorists.""

If India is truly confident in its claims, why avoid third-party investigations? Why censor independent media in Kashmir? The truth is, this “Rafael jet” propaganda and war-hype is used to cover up failures at home, and it's time people saw through that.

Why do you need to know what somebody looked like to know if they existed? Historians have a consensus that Prophet Muhammad existed in history because we have contemporary sources that mention him. Here are a few examples:

(1) The Doctrina Jacobi Nuper Baptizati is a 7th century work by a Christian written in 634 CE, only two years after the Prophet passed away.

In this dialogue between a Christian and some Jews, the author reveals the appearance of a new Prophet among the Saracens (Arabs):

When the candidatus was killed by the Saracens, I was at Caesarea and I set off by boat to Sykamina. People were saying ""the candidatus has been killed,"" and we Jews were overjoyed. And they were saying that the prophet had appeared, coming with the Saracens, and that he was proclaiming the advent of the anointed one, the Christ who was to come.

- R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, p. 57

(2) Chronicle of 640 CE by a Syriac Orthodox priest Thomas the Presbyter records the battle of Dathin between the Romans and the Arabs and it mentions Prophet Muhammad by name:

On Friday, 4 February, at the ninth hour, there was a battle between the Romans and the Arabs of Muhammad in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza...

- R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, p. 119 and p. 120

(3) Khuzistan Chronicle is a short 7th century Nestorian chronicle which gives a brief account of the Muslim invasion of Persia and mentions that they were under the leadership of Muhammad:

Then God raised up against them the sons of Ishmael, numerous as the sand on the sea shore, whose leader was Muhammad. Neither walls nor gates, armor or shield, withstood them, and they gained control over the entire land of Persians.

- R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, p. 186

(4) One of the most interesting 7th century accounts about Prophet Muhammad comes from Sebeos who was a Bishop of the House of Bagratunis.

Sebeos is the first non-Muslim author to present us with a theory for the rise of Islam that pays attention to what the Muslims themselves thought they were doing:

At that time a certain man from along those same sons of Ishmael, whose name was Muhammad, a merchant, as if by God's command appeared to them as a preacher and the path of truth. He taught them to recognize the God of Abraham, especially because he was learnt and informed in the history of Moses. Now because the command was from on high, at a single order they all came together in unity of religion. Abandoning their vain cults, they turned to the living God who had appeared to their father Abraham. So, Muhammad legislated for them: not to eat carrion, not to drink wine, not to speak falsely, and not to engage in fornication. He said: 'With an oath God promised this land to Abraham and his seed after him for ever. And he brought about as he promised during that time while he loved Israel. But now you are the sons of Abraham and God is accomplishing his promise to Abraham and his seed for you. Love sincerely only the God of Abraham, and go and seize the land which God gave to your father Abraham. No one will be able to resist you in battle, because God is with you.

- R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, p. 129

We can see that Sebeos knows plenty of personal information about Prophet Muhammad. For example, he is aware that Muhammad was a merchant by profession before his Prophethood. He hints that his life was suddenly changed by a divinely inspired revelation.

He presents a good summary of Prophet Muhammad's preaching i.e belief in One God and Abraham as a common ancestor of Jews and Arabs. He even picks out some of the prohibitions which are mentioned in the Qur'an, such as false speech and drinking of alcohol.

All this information that Sebeos presents accurately conforms to the Islamic traditions. Many take such detailed, early and accurate accounts about Prophet Muhammad for granted but it's actually quite rare with figures from ancient history.",@moizahmed4705,0,1747008000,True,UgxLfsWj6ymMKx0yluh4AaABAg

If the universe began to exist, then it could have not existed. Things that begin to exist are contingent—they depend on causes. Since the universe began to exist (e.g., via the Big Bang), it is contingent.

Everything that exists has an explanation—either in the necessity of its own nature or in something outside it. The universe exists, but it doesn’t seem to exist by necessity (it could have been otherwise, or not at all). Therefore, its existence must be explained by something external—a necessary being (e.g., God). The key point is that the universe doesn’t explain itself; it depends on something else.

The physical constants and laws of the universe (gravity, speed of light, etc.) could have been different. This suggests the universe is not necessary, but tuned in a particular way—which implies contingency.

We can coherently conceive of a world where the universe doesn’t exist. If something can be imagined not to exist, it is not logically necessary. Therefore, the universe is contingent.",@moizahmed4705,0,1747008000,True,UgxLfsWj6ymMKx0yluh4AaABAg

UgwfyUrmHFJGePGEPSV4AaABAg,"There are growing connections between Zionist ideology, the governments of Israel and India, and the shaping of Western media narratives.

*Zionist Connections with India and Israel*  
In recent decades, India and Israel have developed a close economic, military, and political relationship, with India becoming a major importer of Israeli arms and surveillance technology. This partnership has deepened under the current government in India, which has shown admiration for Zionist strategies, especially regarding the occupation of Kashmir and the treatment of minorities.  
Both Zionism in Israel and Hindutva in India share ethno-nationalist outlooks, and their alliance is rooted in common interests, including similar approaches to security and expansionism. India has adopted Israeli-style tactics in Kashmir, such as using advanced security technologies and settlement models, and both governments use similar rhetoric about terrorism and national security.

*Influence Over Western Media*  
Pro-Israeli or Zionist groups have significant influence over major Western media outlets, which often shapes coverage to favor Israeli perspectives and downplay or justify state violence against Palestinians and, by extension, similar actions by allied governments like India.  
Mainstream Western outlets frequently rely on official sources from these governments and frame developments from a perspective that supports their narratives, often minimizing reports of human rights abuses in Gaza and other occupied territories.  
This media environment reinforces the political and ideological alliance between Israel and India, while also marginalizing dissenting voices and the perspectives of affected populations in places like Gaza and Kashmir.

In conclusion, the alliance between Zionist elements and the Indian government is not only political and military but also extends to the management and framing of narratives in Western media, leading to a one-sided portrayal of conflicts in Gaza and Kashmir and shaping global public opinion accordingly.",@ShahZoor-u4e,0,1747094400,False,

Whether it was the Israelites then or Hindus now, those who glorify falsehood over truth tread the same path of humiliation, spiritual blindness, and divine wrath.

I've seen media that leans towards pakistan, media that leans towards india, either way its crazy to me that pakistan has never once said we'll take care of our terrorists, they just keep denying the existence of groups like TRF, lakshar e taiba, balochistan, taliban, jasihe mohammed. Why are there so many terrorists groups coming out of pakistan and why is it never owning up to it? Terrorists captured have claimed they were trained in these locations, but pakistan never done anything about it? and they gave state funerals?

Even aljazeera claims we don't know who started the violation of the ceasefire but you seem so sure india violated it. 
I'm not someone who supports india for all its actions, like the hindu extremists, but neither do i support islamic extremists. 
And I'm still doubtful if the attack was carried out by terrorists or india set it up, but im leaning towards the fact that TRF terrorist group did it, as they claimed responsbility for the pahalgam attack. (they then backfired and said indians hacked thier account which seems like a convenient bogus). The other day with mohamed hijab you made another point that pakistanis couldn't have crossed the border into pahalgam, but i dont think any media even claimed pakistanis crossed border, they claimed pakistanis living in indian occupied kashmir carried out the attack. All that about the FIR being filed 10 minutes after is bogus, FIR filed around an hour after the attack started, 10 minutes after the attack ended, it depends on how you look at it, nobody can say for sure it's even an argument against anything. unlike uk, you don't have to wait 10 minutes waiting time to get your phone answered. Anyway I feel like heavy bias on this issue, and you don't get to hear much opposing thoughts because of the fanbase. Lot of muslims simply take pakistan side because pakistan flag is associated with islam, this is not speculation it's evident.

Ugxp6uyDNoCGfdnKLRZ4AaABAg,"FACTUAL RECAP – THE KIRANA HILLS STRIKE & ITS AFTERMATH
	1.	India struck Kirana Hills — a confirmed weapons and drone storage depot with high-value military and strategic assets, some reportedly 
                supplied by foreign allies of Pakistan. This was not symbolic. It was precise and devastating.
	2.	Confirmed Fallout:
	•	Over 50 PAF personnel are believed to have died.
	•	Over 100 trained terrorists and handlers were also neutralized.
	•	Radiation leakage was detected after the hit, as the area was formerly used for illegal nuclear testing by Pakistan.
	•	Satellite and SIGINT confirm unusual heat and radiation signatures, pointing to damaged nuclear-grade materials.
	3.	Pakistan’s Military Readiness Collapsed:
	•	Intelligence reports indicate fuel and spare parts shortages in Pakistan’s Air Force.
	•	7-day war readiness? Exposed as a bluff. Pakistan would not have lasted beyond 4 days in a sustained conflict.
	•	US pressure and back-channel panic in Islamabad forced a rapid de-escalation request.
	4.	India Didn’t De-escalate out of Fear – It Chose Control:
	•	The IAF went deep, struck, and returned.
	•	India communicated to Pakistan post-strike, clarifying it was aimed at terror infrastructure — a clear ‘do not retaliate’ message.
	•	Pakistan responded with scattered drone strikes, most of which were either intercepted or hit non-critical areas.
	5.	Narrative War:
	•	India’s military and government briefings were precise, calculated, and unified — whether one agrees with the message or not.
	•	Pakistan’s response was a mix of Twitter memes, PR stunts, and chest-thumping — with no actual strategic gains.
	6.	Strategic Picture:
	•	India’s strategic objective was met: dismantle a major weapons hub, expose Pakistan’s vulnerability, and show precision dominance.
	•	Pakistan’s narrative win on social media doesn’t change the material losses it suffered.

CLARITY FOR THE DELUDED

India is using this incident by blaming Pakistan and using this pretext to attack Pakistan.
Pakistan Air Force is protecting Pakistan against the aggressive India.
Kudos to Pakistan Air Force for protecting Pakistan against the aggressive India.
The use of the PL-15 missile in combat by Pakistan's J-10C fighters represents a significant milestone for the missile and underscores the advanced capabilities of the J-10C platform.
The Kashmir conflict started in 1947 with India claimed the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiris are not terrorists. 
They are fighting against the invading Indian troops for 3 decades now. 
The Modi administration took many measures including scrapping the autonomous status of the Indian-administered Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state, and passing the Citizenship Amendment Act. 
These moves have catered to the demands of Hindu nationalists and fueled their arrogance. 
We witnessed India trying to erased whatever traces of the Muslim existence in the public institution and in the public realm to decimates the lifestyle and customs of the Muslim minorities into a non-entity in the aggressive Hindu government by implementing laws and using Hindu mobs to terrorized the Muslims into submission. 
India attempts to re-write history on Kashmir. 
It is in the Indian psychic to discriminate against the helpless minorities in India.  
Religious bigotry and racial bigotry are abundant in India due to the Indian hierarchy and caste systems. 
Using anti-conversion bill to carry out discrimination against minority right to choose their religious beliefs and punish them from practicing it is beneath contempt of human dignity. 
It is religious genocide to the extreme by the Hindu nationalist government on other minorities group in India. 
It is a crime on humanity. and should be a reminder for us all to save mankind of hatred and discrimination against each other, especially in India.

And how did Pakistan retaliate? By killing innocent civilians in Poonch 13 lives taken with children by heavy shelling? And after that failed missile attempts causing no serious damage at all.

UgyFu6r9O8QsTc0E0Ch4AaABAg,"Quranic Verses:
📖 Surah Al-Hajj (22/40) ""Those who were expelled from their homes unjustly, only because they said: ‘Our Lord is Allah!’ And if Allah did not repel some people by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques—where Allah’s name is much mentioned—would have been destroyed. Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.""

📖 Surah Al-Imran (3:140) ""If a wound has touched you, a similar wound has touched the people before you. Such are the days that We alternate among the people, so that Allah may distinguish those who believe and take martyrs from among you. And Allah does not love the wrongdoers.""

Scholarly Explanations:
📖 Tafsir of Surah Al-Hajj (22/40): 🔹 Ibn Kathir – Explains that this verse speaks about Allah’s justice in protecting believers and their places of worship. Allah ensures balance among nations, preventing one group from completely overpowering another. 🔹 Al-Jalalayn – Emphasizes that believers were unjustly expelled, but Allah supports them and protects their religious sites. 🔹 Qurtubi – Highlights that Allah’s help is always with those who strive in His cause.

📖 Tafsir of Surah Al-Imran (3/140): 🔹 Ibn Kathir – States that victory and defeat alternate as a test for believers. Allah examines people to distinguish true believers from hypocrites. 🔹 Ma'arif-ul-Quran – Points out that Allah’s wisdom shapes history, granting victory to one side at times and another at other times. 🔹 Qurtubi – Stresses that martyrs hold a special status with Allah, and losses serve as part of His divine plan to purify the community from weaknesses.

Conclusion:
These two verses illustrate Allah’s justice and wisdom in governing the fate of nations. Victory and defeat are part of Allah’s divine plan, serving as tests for believers. Muslims must remain patient and steadfast, knowing that Allah supports those who strive in His cause and that every challenge carries a deeper purpose within His plan.",@WANTED-BIH,0,1747008000,False,
