During the 1967 Arab - Israeli war he formed part of a  contingent of Pakistani pilots who volunteered to fly for the participating Arab states. Mervyn was sent to Jordan. Later on Middlecoat was KIA during the 1971 war.

Incidently, the legendary Saif ul Azam, flew for both Iraq and also Jordan. He was credited with shooting down 4 Israeli jets, in total. During the 1965 he had shot down at least 1 indian aeroplane. Sadly, due to being of Bengali origin, Saif ul Azam was not permitted to fight during the tragic 1971 war. Soon after he went to the new state of Bangladesh, where he held prominent and senior positions in both military and civil aviation. He died in Dhaka in 2020, mourned by many, including numerous senior PAF officers.

Another PAF pilot of Bengali origin, M.M Alam became an extremely rare 'Ace in a day' when he shot down FIVE indian planes in a couple of minutes during the 1965 war. Again, ashamedly, Alam, due to being of Bengali heritage was denied permission to fly during the 1971 war.

Our heartfelt prayers are with his parents, regardless of their religious background.

As a society, we tend to admire heroes when they succeed—standing beside them in moments of glory. Yet, when they face challenges, true support is often lacking. This tendency exists among both Muslims and non-Muslims, though, regrettably, it is sometimes more pronounced towards non-Muslimism. The story and struggles of javelin athlete and Olympic gold medalist Arshad Nadeem are a good example of this tendency.

If we truly follow the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah, we must uphold the dignity and rights of people from all religions on merit.

I agree with you somewhat, i dont know what country your from but im from the U.K., let me say that i condemn any oppression against humans regardless of their faith, i dont agree with what these so called fake muslims are doing by brainwashing the youths mind, these people are born and bred in the UK but they go against it when clearly the prophet Muhammad PBUH and the holy quran cleary states that if the country you live in dont interfere with your faith then you should be absolutely  loyal to it, and we get more religious freedom in the UK then some of the muslim countries around the world and these people still brainwash the youth the wrong way, these people are not only causing unrest in the western countries but they are giving islam a bad reputation and the holy prophet Muhammad pbuh too, And they call them selves good muslims
please read below what ive got from the internet and please do more research on it yourself. Ive asked them this question that Islam asks muslims to be loyal to the country they live in many times and why are you brainwashing the youths against this country and ive not got one reply back from any one of them Smile to jhanna, Ali dawaha, Mohammed Hijab etc
Jazak Allah khair 

What is Islam’s view on obedience to the law of the land?

In Islam obedience to the law of the land is a religious duty. The Qur’an commands Muslims to remain faithful to not only Allah and the Prophet Muhammad(sa), but also the authority they live under:

O ye who believe! obey Allah, and obey His Messenger and those who are in authority over you (Ch.4: V.60).

Any country or government that guarantees religious freedom to followers of different faiths (not just Islam) must be owed loyalty. The Prophet Muhammad(sa) stressed this point when he said:

 ‘One who obeys his authority, obeys me. One who disobeys his authority, disobeys me.’ (Muslim)
This makes clear that according to Islam Muslims must obey the law of the land as anything to the contrary would mean that they are not obeying their Prophet or their religion.",@PATRIOTICBRITAIN42,1,1747440000,True,UgyWAIj5GNeEtihoE8N4AaABAg

However, Indian authorities have not confirmed any successful Pakistani airstrikes on Indian airbases during this period.

So Allah said about that: 'And on that day, the believers will rejoice - with the help of Allah. He helps whom He wills, and He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful (30:4 & 5). The Quraish wanted the Persians to be victorious since they were not people of the Book, nor did they believe in the Resurrection. So when Allah revealed these Ayat, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, went out, proclaiming throughout Makkah: 'Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, in Bid' years (30:1-4).' Some of the Quraish said: 'Then this is (a bet) between us and you. Your companion claims that the Romans will defeat the Persians in Bid' years, so why have have a bet on that between us and you?' Abu Bakr said: 'Yes.' This was before betting has been forbidden. So Abu Bakr and the idolaters made a bet, and they said to Abu Bakr: 'What do you think - Bid' means something between three and nine years, so let us agree on the middle.' So they agreed on six years; Then six years passed without the Romans being victorious. The idolaters took what they won in the bet from Abu Bakr. When the seventh year came and the Romans were finally victorious over the Persians, the Muslims rebuked Abu Bakr for agreeing to six years. He said: 'Because Allah said: 'In Bid' years.' At that time, many people became Muslims.""

The west with Thier agenda , stepped to india, and carved it to three , then America came and sed let us show u how to do it , Americans went in to AFRICA and carved it up to many nations, but we trusted the west , when the English went to America , they gave the natives Indians , jin and got them drunk and tried to falsely take deeds, that didn't work so they went guns blazing . 

In plain simple English , there was never no world wars , or counties being invaded, rather every nation had thier rich culture for everyone to see for free, passports and borders wer created by this west agenda, although alot of you say Pakistan and Bangladesh had war , NEVER , use your head , you think Pakistan was going to march its army through india ( in india they was killing most god fearing people agenda muslims , and re wite their history)  lose half its army to the devil army of the west , amd then go straight in to the next border Bangladesh, to then have another war , lose a few more men , even if they won , they still have to take the same route back , and lose more men by the west army . Bangladesh and Pakistan and india , never had no issues, untill the brits navy army, had arrived 1947 if im correct.

Ugx4c6anlrIpeu1EkUd4AaABAg.AI9TxZWDZEDAI9nNYM1dFj," @fizzel5711  Well according to a Pak Govt Doc it is stated: "" a radiation leak happened in Northern Pakistan on 11 May 2025, near Chattar Plain. The leak involved a highly radioactive Indium-192 capsule. The government is calling it an “industrial incident” at a non-destructive testing (NDT) unit, but the location and response strongly suggest something deeper—possibly linked to a military or nuclear-related site. The exposure level was extremely dangerous: 14.2 millisieverts/hour, way above safe limits. ""The precautionary zone was initially 300 meters, then suddenly reduced to 30 meters within a day, which goes against standard international safety protocols (like IAEA guidelines). You don’t just shrink a radiation danger zone overnight unless you’re trying to hide something.

The official reason for the leak is listed as a “mechanical failure of a shickling mechantern,” which is not even a real technical term. That alone should raise questions. Either the government doesn’t know what happened—or they do and are deliberately using gibberish to confuse people.

Local residents were told to get medical screenings, but the public was told “there’s no cause for alarm.” If everything was under control, why notify people within a 2 km radius? Why the secrecy?

This area isn’t known for regular industrial work but is near sensitive military zones. There is a strong chance this wasn’t just an accident—this could be a targeted strike or internal mishandling involving radiological or nuclear materials. The lack of media coverage in Pakistan and globally is also suspicious. Why has there been no press release from ISPR, no mention on state TV, and no international headlines despite the IAEA being notified?

This looks like a serious incident that’s being quietly covered up to avoid panic, protect military credibility, and prevent questions about the safety of Pakistan’s nuclear materials. Ordinary people have a right to transparency—especially when radiation exposure is involved. If this happened in India, Iran, or North Korea, international media would be all over it. But here? Silence.

Wake up. Ask questions. This is not a small issue.",@Dasaanudasa108,0,1747440000,True,Ugx4c6anlrIpeu1EkUd4AaABAg

 The most important and largest air battles of the 21st century, featuring the latest technologies in several fields...revealed the Pakistani military power and Pakistanis advance in technology

In addition to the revelation of Chinese military technology, which is today the undisputed number one in the world, decades ahead of the American military and light years ahead of the European and Russian military, the spotlight has also been shed on the false propaganda that the West has relied on for thirty years for its military industry. 
In addition, the revelation of the Indians' mastery of lying and their continuous lying in all fields, similar to the Zionist method...

Regarding this latest battle, I've been observing everything for the past two weeks and noticed that Indian news channels are filled with fantasy, false narratives, ego-driven shouting, and insulting language. People in India seem angry and frustrated, while on the Pakistani side, the tone appears much more mature, positive, and calm.

First of all, the Pakistani Air Force is professional and serious, but they are only a negligible beneficiary of China's systematic combat concept. Modern air combat is no longer the era of dogfighting during World War II. Without the help of satellites, early warning aircraft, electronic warfare capabilities and comprehensive battlefield situation awareness, you have already lost the war. It's just that India did not realize this. India's large-scale air force mobilization is like running naked in front of Pakistan, and even the communication signals have been intercepted by Pakistan. Even under such a disadvantage, the Indians chose to attack rashly, which is really stupid.

The Chinese J-10 is over two decades old and is 2 generations behind China's best 6th gen combat aircraft (J-36 & J-50). If the French Rafale cannot even defeat a J-10C, what chance does it have against 5th gen J-20 and J-35, yet alone the 6th gen prototypes? By the way, US miliary contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon will be running into major bottlenecks due to China's rare earth metal export bans, so don't expect India or any other country to have plentiful access to US F-22s, F-35s, or the NGAD F-47 that will be in powerpoint presentation mode for over a decade

That debacle of Indian Air Force proves al least two things. The quality can prevail over the quantity. And sometimes the cheaper is better than the expensive means.
Actually a nation with 1,400 million people and large army was defeated in battle by a nation with only 200 million people and minor quantity of weapons. That was the greatest air battle after the World War two and make history.

The Pakistani Muslim Army is great and has won a great victory over the Indian Zionist terrorists.

The current Muslim majority in Kashmir are not outsiders; they are likely the descendants of the very same people who once practiced Hinduism but gradually converted to Islam over centuries, particularly during the spread of Islam in the region from the 14th century onward. This means the Kashmiri people have remained rooted to their land throughout history — their identity has evolved, but their connection to the land has not changed. On the other hand, many of the modern Hindus claiming ancestral ties to Kashmir come from other regions of India and have no direct historical or cultural link to the land or its people. Thus, using ancient religious demographics to justify political control ignores the lived reality and rights of the people who have continuously inhabited Kashmir for generations.",@popcop5356,0,1747440000,True,UgxLlflyArQNNWSNQjV4AaABAg

کامران بشیر کے  میری رائے 
۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔
کامران بشیر جیسا شاندار اور جاندار پائلٹ پوری ائیر فورس میں نہیں ہے اور اس نے بھارتی فضائیہ کو دھول چٹا دی۔ کامران بشیر کے رشتے داروں نے سوشل میڈیا پر دھوم مچا رکھی ہے۔ 
۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔
 پاکستان میں مسیحی بھائیوں کی ابادی کے تناسب  سے فضائیہ میں مسیحی ہیروز کا تناسب بہت زیادہ ہے  ۔ 
ائیر کموڈور سیسل چودھری،  گروپ کیپٹن پیٹر اورائلی٫  سکواڈرن لیڈر جان ڈی سوزا ، فلائیٹ لیفٹیننٹ الفریڈ ، ونگ کمانڈر میزولی (میرا پسندیدہ )  اور بہت سے  ایسے ہیں جنہوھ نے مادر وطن کے دفاع میں کمال کیا۔ 
لیکن اس بار کامران بشیر کے رشتہ داروں نے بڑی زیادتی کی
 
کامران بشیر جیسا کہ سینے پر موجود بلے(بیج) سے ہی معلوم ہو جاتا ہے کہ یہ پائلٹ نہیں نیویگیٹر ہیں۔ 
کوئی دور تھا جب فائٹر جہاز میں ایک پائلٹ اور ایک نیویگیٹر ہوا کرتا تھا۔ آج پائلٹ ہوا میں ہوتا ہے زمین پر راڈار کھولے اسے نیویگیشن کی سہولت بہت سے سسٹمز کے ساتھ ساتھ یہ نیویگیٹر بھی  مہیا کرتا ہے۔ 
عین ممکن ہے کہ کامران بشیر نے کسی خاص مشن میں بہترین نیویگیشن کی ہو لیکن یہ مکمل غلط خبر  ہے کہ کامران فائیٹر اڑا کر انڈیا پہنچ گیا۔ 
میں کافی دنوں سے چپ تھا کہ مسیحی بھائیوں کے دلوں پر کوئی پیلاہٹ نہ پڑے  لیکن اب کچھ زیادتی ہو رہی ہے۔ 
مثلا آج ایک وائرل پوسٹ تھی کہ حکومت نے اگر کامران بشیر کو ایواڈ نہ دیا تو قوم یہ کر دے گی  وہ  کر دے گی۔ 
پھر جو دعوے اس کے سر ڈالے جا رہے ہیں وہ بذات خود بھارتی میڈیا کے لیے ایک بہت بڑا موقع ہو گا کہ پاکستان میں کیسے غیر پیشہ ورانہ ٹرینڈ چل رہے ہیں۔ ایک نیویگیٹر کیسے جہاز چلا سکتا ہے۔ 
جنگ کے دنوں میں ہیرو پیدا کرنا اور ان کو گلوریفائے کرنا قدیم انسانی سرشت ہے لیکن یہ اگر ریاستی سطح پر ہو تو بہتر ہے  
پاک فضائیہ کو دشمن سے پنجہ آزمائی سے فرصت ہی نہیں کہ وہ ان اندرونی معاملات پر غور کر سکے۔ 
یوں  سمجھیے کہ جس طرح فضائیہ بھارتی فضاوں میں بغیر کسی روک ٹوک یا خوف کے گھومنے لگی ہے بعینہ ہمارے ہاں جعلی خبروں کا بازار بھی اتنی ہی آزادی سے گھومنے لگا ہے۔ 
تسلی رکھیے ابھی آپ نے فضائیہ کا میڈیا پر ایک چنک دیکھا ہے۔ 
یہ نیلے بڑے مزے دار ہیں۔ یہ مکمل سیلیبریٹ کرتے ہیں۔ تمام ممالک کے ملٹری اتاشی مع سفراء بلوا کر یہ ایک ایک اچی بچی دنیا کے سامنے مع پروف پیش کر دیں گے۔ 
لائیو بھارتی پائلٹوں کی وہ آڈیو سنائیں گے جس میں ان کا سسٹم ہیک کر لیا گیا تھا اور وہ ایک دوسرے کو پکار رہے تھے مگر سن صرف پاک فضائیہ رہی تھی۔ 
پاک فضائیہ کے سائبر ڈائریکٹوریٹ کس قدر کامیاب رہی کہ اب شاید کئی ماہ اپنے پنجابی سکھ بجلی کے بل نہیں  دیں گے مفت استعمال کریں گے۔ 
بھارت نے البتہ دنیا کی بڑی کمپنیوں کو اوپن ٹاسک دیا ہے کہ آ کر ہمارا سسٹم پاک فضائیہ کے چنگل سے نکال دو
 
ایسا بڑا سائبر ونگ رکھنے والے فوج کے بارے آپ کیا سمجھتے ہیں اگر ان کا دھیان اندر ہوتا تو کامران بشیر مسیح کی غلط خبر پھیل جاتی
 نہیں۔ 
لیکن یہ اس کی پیشہ ورانہ مجبوری اور فرض ہے کہ وہ صرف بیرونی دشمنوں سے پیکار رہنے کا حلف اٹھائے ہوئے ہے۔ 
باقی اندر تب وہ منہ کرے گی جب کوئی حالات بہتر ہوں گے۔ 
آخری گزارش یہ ہے کہ پاکستان  کے بہتر امیج کے لیے کامران بشیر کی پوسٹوں کے نیچے حقیقت درج کریں۔ 
یونہی بھارتی میڈیا کے ہاتھ ایک بکواس اشو آ گیا تو ان کو بتنگڑ بنانا خوب آتا ہے۔",@asadahmed2195,0,1747440000,False,

Everyone knows that India won the war and have shown proof of taking down countless terror cites that Pakistani government gave refuge to as well as almost a dozen air bases. India also did not lose a single thing until Pak broke the ceasefire agreement they begged for. The Pak army made this ceasefire to get money from the IMF to refuel the war effort and after getting the money they broke the agreement and attacked India. India has been good and never bothered Pakistan but it seems Pakistan has been asking for a war. I have met several pakistani's here in America and they are very good people who are quite spirited and some have even become good friends of mine.

The non-Muslim pop. of present day Pakistan (West Pakistan until 1971) has in fact  grown and not declined. 

It was the eastern wing or East Pakistan which  became Bangladesh in 1971 that had a sizeable non-Muslim population. So when East Pakistan left in 1971, that naturally reduced the figure of non Muslims in Pakistan. 

Present day Pakistan or   West Pakistan until 1971, was always predominantly Muslim since Islam arrived there  in the 8th century. 

This is unsurprising considering its geog location in South-Central Asia. Almost the entire swathe from Pakistan to Central Asia, all the way to Turkey, Central Asian republics,  the Caucasus to  Bosnia and Albania, to West Asia and North Africa, to much of West Africa, the Horn of Africa and much of East Africa, is almost entirely Muslim. This is the 'heartland of the Islamic world'  and it is one land mass.

Whilst Pakistan and its people are not imperfect  and have flaws, generally speaking most people are fairly tolerant and don't bother religious minorities. The Quran clearly states ""there is no compulsion in religion"".",@YourHonor-h1v,0,1747440000,True,UgxjGktCBO0J7GwlmAJ4AaABAg

 The most important and largest air battles of the 21st century, featuring the latest technologies in several fields...revealed the Pakistani military power and Pakistanis advance in technology

In addition to the revelation of Chinese military technology, which is today the undisputed number one in the world, decades ahead of the American military and light years ahead of the European and Russian military, the spotlight has also been shed on the false propaganda that the West has relied on for thirty years for its military industry. 
In addition, the revelation of the Indians' mastery of lying and their continuous lying in all fields, similar to the Zionist method...

Regarding this latest battle, I've been observing everything for the past two weeks and noticed that Indian news channels are filled with fantasy, false narratives, ego-driven shouting, and insulting language. People in India seem angry and frustrated, while on the Pakistani side, the tone appears much more mature, positive, and calm.

First of all, the Pakistani Air Force is professional and serious, but they are only a negligible beneficiary of China's systematic combat concept. Modern air combat is no longer the era of dogfighting during World War II. Without the help of satellites, early warning aircraft, electronic warfare capabilities and comprehensive battlefield situation awareness, you have already lost the war. It's just that India did not realize this. India's large-scale air force mobilization is like running naked in front of Pakistan, and even the communication signals have been intercepted by Pakistan. Even under such a disadvantage, the Indians chose to attack rashly, which is really stupid.

The Chinese J-10 is over two decades old and is 2 generations behind China's best 6th gen combat aircraft (J-36 & J-50). If the French Rafale cannot even defeat a J-10C, what chance does it have against 5th gen J-20 and J-35, yet alone the 6th gen prototypes? By the way, US miliary contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon will be running into major bottlenecks due to China's rare earth metal export bans, so don't expect India or any other country to have plentiful access to US F-22s, F-35s, or the NGAD F-47 that will be in powerpoint presentation mode for over a decade

That debacle of Indian Air Force proves al least two things. The quality can prevail over the quantity. And sometimes the cheaper is better than the expensive means.
Actually a nation with 1,400 million people and large army was defeated in battle by a nation with only 200 million people and minor quantity of weapons. That was the greatest air battle after the World War two and make history.

The Pakistani Muslim Army is great and has won a great victory over the Indian Zionist terrorists.

Later on, Middlecoat was KIA during the 1971 war. 
Incidently, the legendary Saif ul Azam flew for both Iraq and Jordan. He was credited with shooting down 4 Israeli jets in total. During 1965, he had shot down at least 1 indian aeroplane. Sadly, due to being of Bengali origin, Saif ul Azam was not permitted to fight during the tragic 1971 war. Soon after, he went to the new state of Bangladesh, where he held prominent and senior positions in both military and civil aviation. He died in Dhaka in 2020, mourned by many, including numerous senior PAF officers. 
Another PAF pilot of Bengali origin, M.M Alam, became an extremely rare 'Ace in a day' when he shot down FIVE indian planes in a couple of minutes during the 1965 war.

Let's assume for a moment that everything the Indian government says is accurate. But have you heard what External Affairs Minister Jaishankar reportedly said? That we informed Pakistan one hour before launching a strike, making it clear our target was terrorists, not the army.

Seriously? We warned the so-called enemy in advance? And we expected the terrorists to stay put and wait for missiles to fall on them? Who are we trying to fool — the world, or ourselves?

And then we’re told we destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases. Yet somehow, they still managed to scramble jets the same night, take down six of our aircraft, and even kill one pilot while injuring two others. Is this what we’re calling a 'great victory'?

Check international media — Reuters, Le Monde, The Economist, The Diplomat, The Telegraph, even France 24 (yes, the same France that sold us Rafales) — many are reporting the actual losses we suffered. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force refuses to release a detailed account of what really happened. Why? What are they hiding?

And when diplomats like Vikram Misri merely announce a ceasefire, they face threats and abuse. Is this the new India — where truth is treason, and blind loyalty is the only accepted narrative?

Let’s be honest — we’ve failed diplomatically, militarily, and morally. The rest of the world is watching us descend into the same extremist trap we once condemned. If we keep silencing dissent, rewriting facts, and weaponizing religion, we won't need enemies. We'll become the very threat we claim to fight — the next version of the Taliban, only with tricolour flags and saffron slogans.",@abbolai,0,1747612800,True,Ugx3Be2cdueeCFoYSmR4AaABAg
