UgxZoKQWfiLapp_EiUZ4AaABAg,"Some days I wonder ""Why has Britain made these borders?"" the Kashmir region is one of the most controversial and beautiful regions on earth. When they were freed from British rule they had a Hind leader but a Muslim population. When the Muslims had an uprising which was backed by Pakistan, so their Leader (a Hindu) asked India for help and in return the Kashmir region (or at least a majority I think)  would join India. As I am sure you know, India was successfully helped the leader beat the Muslim rebels and in return a majority of the land has been ""occupied"" (although I do not know if that is the right word to use) by India for god knows how long. At the moment I am truly astonished by how religion can cause so much conflict. If you were a Christian (for example) with a Muslim ( for example) neighbour, you shouldn't say ""I have a Muslim neighbour"" you should only say ""I have a neighbour"", same thing with Muslims, it's not ""I have a Christian neighbour"" it is simply ""I have a neighbour"". I know and I am sorry to say this as I know its not in my rights to talk about since I am neither Christian nor Muslim.

this all has started few months back when china and pakistan didn't allow india to build a water reservoir on himaliyas under the indus water treaty ( i can also provide proper facts if you are interested to know the complete story) then indian government needed some solid reasons to completely withdraw from that treaty. so this all drama has started due to water... this is war for water, not for terrorism...

Those who were behind the phalgram incident, they did that to use this incident as a catalyst to spread hatred and destroy peace, they are still at the win. They achieved what they wanted out of this, it's unfortunate but that's the fact.
If India is doing all this to avenge that phalgram incident then why they tried to destroy our neelum jhelum hydropower , that's so crucial for Pakistan, that's situated first in the water flow between Pak n india, this was the hidden agenda behind this so called terrorism war... shifting the focus of their people and world to hide the fact because now world focus is on terrorism but no one is talking about indus water treaty....
this all has started few months back when china and pakistan didn't allow india to build a water reservoir on himaliyas under the indus water treaty ( i can also provide proper facts if you are interested to know the complete story) then indian government needed some solid reasons to completely withdraw from that treaty. so this all drama has started due to water... this is war for water, not for terrorism...

UgwspG9LvhegLlIVF514AaABAg,"Pakistan is not India's enemy; most Pakistanis don't even consider Indians different from themselves, and there's no culture of hatred on the Pakistani side. The real issue lies with Modi's political party, the BJP, which is founded upon an extremist, racist, and anti-minority ideology. For decades, the BJP has fostered a culture built upon deceptive hatred, racist terror against minorities, and media manipulation within India. This is precisely why the BJP is dangerous for global peace. Moreover, this party is far from universally supported even within India itself.

How can this man, Modi, driven by personal ambitions for power, risk starting a war with a nuclear power? This individual is a criminal and the Indian people absolutely must not support him, nor should Western countries continue to shield his actions due to any kind of partnership. The BJP thrives on a ""divide and conquer"" strategy reminiscent of British colonialism and partition. People continue to fall into the same historical traps!

We must remain focused and avoid falling prey to media manipulation. Consider both versions and draw your own analyses and conclusions. There are many media lies, particularly from the Indian side, significant banning of foreign and independent media within India, forced censorship imposed by the government on Indian media, and profound silence from Western media.

India is also expected to respond to Pakistan's request for an independent investigation to ascertain the truth behind events in ""Indian"" Kashmir (their silence suggests a false flag operation, and India fears that its atrocious acts in Indian-administered Kashmir will be clearly revealed to the world). It is also peculiar that Modi's first reaction after this attack was to revoke the Indus River treaty—a step that no one in history has dared take, as it constitutes an act of war in itself.

Sequence of events:

1 - False flag operation by BJP on its own Indian territory to blame Pakistan, enabling the revocation of the Indus River treaty (controlling 80% of Pakistan's water) and manipulating public opinion for electoral gains.
2 - Unilateral and illegal Indian revocation of the Indus River treaty (act of war).
3 - India's failure to respond to Pakistan's request for an independent international investigation into the actual events in ""Indian"" Kashmir. Pakistan demands that India de-escalate its warlike intentions and refrain from altering the treaty.
4 - Escalation of tensions and provocations by India.
5 - Initial Indian attack on Pakistani territory (primarily targeting civilian institutions).
6 - Pakistan's response (primarily targeting military bases, jets, and drones).
7 - Indian attack (primarily targeting civilian institutions).
8 - Pakistan's response (primarily targeting military bases).
9 - Escalation of tensions continues.",@lemniscate0037,2,1746921600,False,

On top of that, the recent interviews of the Pakistani officials felt like they are hiding something. I mean, why didn't they ""outright deny"" any involvement with this attack and why didn't they ever mention they will start an investigation to put it under justice? Every damn time they were beating around the bush to answer the questions.

Still, I personally cannot pinpoint who is the culprit here, whether it is a false flag operation for Bihar election or the terrorist attack that took lives were actually from deranged groups of people to start a division in the region. Only Allah knows best. Because of this ""terror incident"", the civilian from both the country has to pay the price. THIS IS what I am worried about.

Anyone? Anyone looking if CIA  was involved in influencing terrorist to do the Kashmir terrorist attack.

🤦‍♀️India & Pakistan. Really? You get totally exploited, occupied, looted by empires. In Roman mode, UK & others slice & dice the borders, for after divide & conquer, to divide & suppress & keep a boot on your necks.

Worst of the SUNNI extremism, vs islamophobic racist Hindu Brahmanism.

As old revolutionary phrase, or not so old with USA a babe of a nation, United we stand, divided we fall.
But there all you nations go, West lights a match, and you set yourselves on fire.

UgzEDod0QFn_JSUSTvJ4AaABAg,"Crying2Jahannam claiming Pakistan “humiliated” India is next-level delusion 🤦‍♂. Let’s break it down:

Pakistan is currently grappling with a serious multidimensional crisis, and it’s not just speculation or propaganda—it’s a reality backed by data, trends, and on-the-ground developments. Economically, the country is in deep trouble. Inflation remains sky-high, making basic goods like food, fuel, and medicine increasingly unaffordable for average families. The Pakistani rupee has lost much of its value in the past few years, and foreign reserves have at times dipped to dangerously low levels, barely covering a few weeks of imports. This has made Pakistan heavily dependent on loans from the IMF and friendly countries like China and Saudi Arabia. But these bailouts often come with tough conditions, and they’re temporary bandages on a worsening wound.

At a political level, Pakistan is plagued by instability. Civil-military relations are tense, and civilian governments have repeatedly been undermined or overthrown. The recent crackdown on Imran Khan and his party revealed deep fissures within the state apparatus. Democracy is struggling to take root because the real power lies elsewhere—in the military establishment, which controls not just defense but also vast economic interests. As a result, trust in institutions is declining rapidly. Even the judiciary has been accused of selective justice and partisanship. Ordinary citizens see a widening gap between rulers and the ruled, and protests are increasingly met with repression.

Sociologically, this crisis is deepened by rising radicalization and intolerance. Sectarian and ethnic divisions are being inflamed rather than addressed. Balochistan remains a hotspot of insurgency, with many locals accusing Islamabad of exploitation and repression. The demand for greater autonomy—or even independence—is no longer fringe in parts of Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Religious minorities face growing persecution, and even mainstream Sunni groups are targeted if they don’t align with the state’s favored narrative.

Internationally, Pakistan’s reputation has taken a hit. Once seen as a key player in regional security, it’s now more often viewed as a haven for terror proxies. FATF grey-listing, allegations of hosting extremists, and its deteriorating relations with neighbors like India and even Iran have isolated it diplomatically. Even long-time allies are becoming cautious.

What makes this more alarming is that many young Pakistanis are waking up to this dysfunction, but voices like Crying2Jahannam (a.k.a. Smile2Jannah) muddy the waters by deflecting blame onto India or the West. They downplay Pakistan’s internal rot and distract their viewers with false bravado and historical revisionism. But deflecting won’t feed the people or fix the broken institutions. It’s time to ask hard questions and face uncomfortable truths.

If Pakistan doesn’t course-correct, the risk isn’t just economic collapse—it’s the fragmentation of the state itself. Already, the warning signs are visible in Balochistan and beyond. It’s not an agenda—it’s what happens when governance fails, minorities are crushed, and lies are repeated to cover up structural decay. Muslims who care about truth and justice should not follow those who romanticize decline or promote victimhood over responsibility.",@Dasaanudasa108,0,1746921600,False,

This war is for waters, India needs to harness what is theirs. Perhaps high time the Ruling generals in the paki government come to their senses that they are fighting a loosing battle. How long will they sustain this with their begging bowl currently emptying. Rather than  subjecting common paki to this annihilation while they enjoy the largesse, better to resolve the myriad of issues bedeviling the 2 nations. The very idea of  hiving off of India into 2 nations was ill conceived , should never have happened in the first place. All those that played this obnoxious game may not be alive today, only fit to be convicted of treason posthumously 
As for the state of Pakistan perpetually seen as a pariah state riddled with corruption, languishing in poverty and all sorts of vices that are anti Islam , with an upper class enjoying the largesse at the expense of the majority poor it can only make sense that the leadership now  changes it's mind set to accommodate dialogue, bring about the societal reform and encourage equal participation of all it's citizens into the progressive movement and stem out plunder of resources for the betterment of all Pakis.

The world have been laughing at China and mocking them with ""made in China"" punchline. But little does everyone knows, China have been making most of the products we use today. 

1) Just from that sheer experience in production itself is enough to put them as equal in quality to the best of the Western world.
2) The Western world seems to forget that many brilliant engineers, scientist, and many more are Chinese or Asian. You can look it up. In America, most scientist and engineers on the forefront research and manufacturing are Chinese. If the ""American"" Chinese are smart, You can bet there are plenty more of these smart Chinese in the 1.416 Billion population of China.
3) Also people seems to forget that China is a socialist country. Everything and everyone is controlled by the government. A country like that can advance in anything extremely quickly if the government deem something is important and throw it's vast resources into it. 

It is extremely stupid to look down on China. Especially if you consider who is China's biggest ally. Russia. Just the combination of these 2 superpower can flood America. But that is not the problem. The problem is the Western world are pulling the strings from the shadows again. Inciting war among us. Asia as a whole should unite instead of fight each other.

Before Phalagham Jaffar train attack happened. 
They know Pakistan is mostly Muslim majority country and can't fight on religion, so create hatred between ethicities, they started to form militants based on ethnicity. Bla and TTP.

Bla did jaffer train attack ( 20+ terrorist) hijacked and killed innocent passengers based on different ethnicities. Just  1month  before Phalagham attack. 
And India Media and ""Major Gaurav"" openly were Laughing and Mocking The Jaffer train attack and were saying that they support  those millitant terrorist and they should do more to break Pakistan on the bases on Ethnicities 

Just 8 or 9 years before ( Indian Raw Agent Kalbushan Ydhav) was arrested From balochistan who was involved in Terrors activities in Balochistan and Karachi city. 
He was Indian Naval Official , was working in Iran and secretly enter go and forth between Iran and Pakistan. 
He funded Millitants to create separate at movement in Pakistan To divide Pakistan. Got arrested in Pakistan during the raid based on intelligence.

India should have the edge over Pakistan in terms of weapons procurement and sheer numbers. However, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has very effective pilots.

For the sake of Allah 

We r one ummah one family 
One Allah 
one leader our beloved 
prophet Muhammad pbuh 

But I don’t like Pakistan government 
For many reasons 
And I didn’t like my Afghanistan secular government 

And Half million afghans killed 2001
By America and nato 
but who supported and given airport and military support and airspace for killing the afghans Muslims?

It was the same Pakistan government 

The same government given our sister aafia siddiqui to the American government 
Even a 8 months old baby girl was handover to the American by 
Pakistan Military chief musharaf 
What her crime?

This 8 months old Muslim baby girl 
Was not terrorist 

The same government given 
Innocent afghans to America government and put them in guantanamo prison 
And rapped and tortured them 

Same government killed more than 
120000
Own Muslims brothers and sisters 
And children 
the Pashtun in Peshawar 
Waziristan swat and rapped their women and kidnapped their sons 

Even now the Pakistan government is trying to destroy the peace process in Afghanistan by America help and supporting the previous government puppet regime 
To start another war in Afghanistan to make money and kill again innocent Muslims and children and women 

We need leader who’s truly standing for Islam and ummah not for secular law and puppet leaders 

Pakistan Army’s record is of killing 25,000 Palestinians in `Black September’ massacre
The Pakistan Army has a horrendous record as Zia ul Haq, a Brigadier back then, had helped train the Jordanians to carry out killing of thousands of Palestinians in an orgy that lasted all of 11 days.

Ugzk2U8-4uvuegs9wSV4AaABAg,"India’s Unilateral Actions Following the 2025 Terrorist Attack Undermine Regional Stability

India’s recent response to the tragic terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 2025 has once again raised serious concerns about its approach to regional security and diplomacy. Rather than engaging with Pakistan through established diplomatic channels or seeking a cooperative investigation into the incident, India unilaterally assigned blame and launched cross-border military strikes—actions that violate international law and undermine the prospects for lasting peace in South Asia.

Pakistan’s record on counterterrorism is clear. Through extensive operations such as Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad, as well as strict implementation of FATF reforms, Pakistan has made sustained and verifiable efforts to eliminate terrorist networks. Furthermore, the country has cooperated with international intelligence agencies and has demonstrated a continued willingness to engage in dialogue on regional security challenges.

Despite these facts, India chose to bypass diplomatic engagement entirely. It made no effort to propose a joint investigation, refused to share evidence through appropriate channels, and instead acted as judge and executioner—resorting to military aggression against a sovereign country. This approach not only echoes the dangerous precedent set by the 2019 Balakot airstrikes but also highlights a pattern of using force over facts.

We know India likes to pretend this is some kind of Israel vs. Hamas situation—but let’s be absolutely clear: Pakistan is not Hamas. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state with a disciplined military and a legacy of strategic resilience. Any attempt to treat Pakistan as a weak, reactionless entity is a grave miscalculation. If India insists on aggression, Pakistan is fully capable of responding—not with words, but with force. This isn’t a one-sided occupation. It’s a standoff between two sovereign states, and if pushed, Pakistan will not hesitate to defend its people and its territory—brutally, if necessary.

To understand the gravity of this escalation, consider a reversal of roles: imagine if a group of violent actors based in India carried out a deadly attack on a Pakistani village, killing dozens of civilians. Then, without reaching out to the Indian government, and without proposing any joint inquiry or evidence-sharing mechanism, Pakistan responded by publicly blaming the Indian state and launching airstrikes on Indian soil. The international community would rightfully condemn such actions as provocative, disproportionate, and unlawful.

This is exactly the kind of dangerous path India has chosen—escalating tensions instead of seeking justice through cooperation. By refusing to work with Pakistan to find those truly responsible and instead taking military action, India has not only undermined international norms but also missed an opportunity to combat terrorism through unity rather than hostility.

The way forward must involve restraint, dialogue, and a shared commitment to the rule of law. Regional peace depends not on unilateral retaliation but on mutual understanding, transparency, and collective security. As long as major powers in the region prioritize political posturing over principled cooperation, the shared goal of eliminating terrorism will remain out of reach.",@MustafaMuhammed1981,0,1746835200,False,

UgxlyiRDLeLaMYKGqXt4AaABAg,"The claim that Pakistan “humiliated” India on the world stage is not just laughable—it’s a masterclass in reverse projection. Let’s dismantle this delusion.

First, Operation Sindoor was a calibrated and precise strike on terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and PoK. India didn’t boast afterward—it didn’t need to. The silence and confusion in Rawalpindi and the abrupt denial of damage told the real story. If Pakistan had downed five or even one Indian plane, we’d have seen grainy video montages by now on every Pakistani news channel. Instead, we got silence and recycled stock footage.

Second, Crying2Jahannum forgets to mention Pakistan’s stunningly reckless attempt to hide a military drone behind a civilian aircraft. This isn’t clever—it’s a war crime. Trying to provoke India into accidentally targeting a civilian aircraft is not strategy; it’s desperation. And it was exposed.

But here’s the more painful truth for Pakistan: it cannot afford a war longer than seven days. Its economy is on life support, surviving on IMF bailouts and Gulf charity. Its ammunition stockpiles are critically low. And internally, Pakistan is on the verge of losing Balochistan. A full-blown insurgency is brewing there, with regular attacks on army convoys and CPEC assets. How can a country bleeding internally dream of fighting a prolonged external war with a far superior economic and military power like India?

Even the Pakistani military knows this. That’s why all their “retaliation” has been digital—tweets, slogans, fake footage, and boys like Crying2Jahannum making YouTube videos to save face.

India doesn’t need to prove anything. It has shown the world that it will strike decisively, act responsibly, and walk away without theatrics. Meanwhile, Pakistan is the one on international watchlists, being scrutinized for state-sponsored terrorism, economic instability, and human rights violations in Balochistan.

So no—Pakistan did not humiliate India. It humiliated itself, yet again.",@Dasaanudasa108,0,1746835200,False,

However, I believe that racism exists everywhere, even in my small village, where some of our neighbors hold prejudiced views. This often stems from the fact that we live abroad and have taken over properties. I think the best way to foster understanding and connection among people is by spreading love. We need to change people's perspectives. Let me share a little story. My family built a house, but my uncle blocked our road with a large wall. To reach our home, we had to take a longer route through someone else's property. My uncle's actions were rooted in his prejudices, as he felt threatened by our success since he didn't have the means to build a house himself. Last year, when I visited Bangladesh, I spoke with my uncle and tried to spread love by bringing clothes and food and helping him out. After a week, I noticed that the wall had been broken down and removed. I was grateful to my uncle for this change, and I wanted to surprise him. I spoke to a builder and arranged for renovations on his house, setting a timeline of one month for completion.
I then took my uncle and his entire family on a holiday outside the city. When they returned after a month, my uncle was overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the new house I had built for him. He even expressed regret for his previous actions, saying he felt as if he had been under some sort of spell. He apologized to my mother, especially since my father had passed away. So, I ask you, why should we let the actions of a few individuals dictate how we feel about an entire community? If someone is unwilling to listen or change, it’s best to distance yourself from them.

My uncle's actions were rooted in his prejudices, as he felt threatened by our success since he didn't have the means to build a house himself. Last year, when I visited Bangladesh, I spoke with my uncle and tried to spread love by bringing clothes and food and helping him out. After a week, I noticed that the wall had been broken down and removed. I was grateful to my uncle for this change, and I wanted to surprise him. I spoke to a builder and arranged for renovations on his house, setting a timeline of one month for completion. I then took my uncle and his entire family on a holiday outside the city. When they returned after a month, my uncle was overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the new house I had built for him. He even expressed regret for his previous actions, saying he felt as if he had been under some sort of spell. He apologized to my mother, especially since my father had passed away.
So, I ask you, why should we let the actions of a few individuals dictate how we feel about an entire community? If someone is unwilling to listen or change, it’s best to distance yourself from them. We shouldn't let the negativity of a few people lead us to hate an entire group.",@Mohammeduzzalmiah,0,1747008000,True,UgwUFiJzLJqCI_V_HR54AaABAg

UgwM3ptvOpYZ2gp6UCV4AaABAg,"What happened?
India used to show off its powerful Air Force, flying advanced jets like Rafales near Pakistan’s border—especially around Kashmir. But now you hardly see Indian fighter jets there. Here’s why:

On May 7, 2025, India tried to hit terrorist camps across the border with a massive air operation—sending around 180 jets. But things didn’t go as planned. Pakistan, using brand new Chinese technology, spotted India’s jets almost instantly and shot down 7 of them. It was a total surprise!

Who lost what?
- India: 3 Rafale jets (crazy expensive), 1 Su-30, 1 MiG-29, and 2 Israeli-made drones.  
- Pakistan: Not a single jet or drone.  
- Score: 7–0 to Pakistan.

How did Pakistan pull this off?
- Pakistan has modern Chinese fighter jets (J-10CE), long-range missiles (PL-15), and strong HQ-9 air defense systems.
- Their tech, like AWACS radar planes, can see and track enemy jets from super far away —even 300km out!
- They didn’t even need to turn on their jet radars. Instead, everything was tracked and guided remotely.
- One Indian Rafale was shot down just 10km from its base, almost as soon as it took off! The Indian pilots *couldn’t see or fight back—the attack came from far away and fast.

So why are Indian jets staying away now?
- Every Rafale costs around $250 million. Losing one is a huge deal; losing more would be a disaster.
- Pakistan’s Chinese tech means they can see Indian jets coming from far away and shoot them down before they get close.
- The risk is too high, so Indian jets now stay around 300km away from the border. 

What’s the big lesson?
- India spent billions on cool foreign jets. But Pakistan (with China’s help) built a smart network—radars, sensors, and missiles all working together.
- Nowadays, air battles aren’t won by just having the most expensive jets. It’s about who has the smartest tech and can connect and spot enemies first.",@tedbilmer,0,1747180800,False,

That move sparked widespread public outrage and turned many Pakistanis against the military. And now, all of a sudden, there’s a wave of pro-army sentiment? It feels like a calculated distraction—possibly with sectarian actors being used to provoke tensions with India. Then, when India responds, the narrative flips, painting India as the aggressor.

This tactic conveniently shifts the public’s attention away from the injustice done to Imran Khan and the broader Pakistani population by the military and ruling elite. It’s a way to manufacture unity and restore the army’s image. Sadly, it highlights how easily public opinion in Pakistan can be manipulated by those in power.

It’s as if the nation lacks a solid foundation—like leaves in the wind, directionless and constantly shifting. This is what happens when institutions are weak, the truth is obscured, and people are systematically misled.",@shamailsiddiqui1680,0,1747094400,False,

In India you never know...what a derogatory statement and everyone who has the slightest ability to think for themselves knows what you're doing here. No, hindus don't worship planes nor cows, it baffles me everytime that people don't grasp this concept.

I'm, again, not a hindu so I'm explaining this because we should be respectful to all other religions. That's what Islam teaches us:

Everyone's God-given human dignity must be respected, regardless of his or her faith, race, ethnic origin, gender, or social status (ref. Qur'an, 17:70). 

But Hindus don't worship cows it's a symbol. Hindus don't worship cows, just like how zoroastrians don't worship fire, just like we don't worship Muhammed (SAW), etc. (And of course there are always individuals who do so, but acts done by individuals shouldn't be used as a generalization because it depicts a not correct idea about the religion itself)

Pakistani airforce personnel set up and developed the airforces of nearly all the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia. Where the Gulf States initial pilots were seconded from the PAF.

During the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars, Pakistani pilots were seconded to the Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi airforces where they shot down zionist jets.

But it does mean the target was legitimate. So, i think you should focus more on verifying or debunking these claims rather than some military equipment which can just be bought again.

You always forget that there are more or atleast almost the equal number of muslims living in india as in pakistan. Its sad that the innocents may have to or are already paying the price because pakistan as a failed nation knows nothing other than expecting alms in the name of being an islamic country. Show me one positive contribution Pakistan brings to the Muslims. Your defense minister has confessed that Pakistan has been training militants, terrorists and doing the dirty work for USA. On a global scale, pakistan is a joke. I am sorry but its the bitter truth. India has its share of bad reputation as well but its positive reputation outweighs the ill reputation through solidarity, educated individuals, contribution to the country where we live and sticking to our roots. Pakistan, on the other hand is a falied state and society. I am speaking from what i have seen in the EU at least. Try to correct your lifestyle first and then come here the comments section.

Ugw9XDl5s8Z9hWaXuh94AaABAg.AHvOHz2Kx1uAHvWpca_Z3f,"Only partly correct. 

Yes, the Pakistani political class and military leaders do not care about its nation or its people. PAKISTANI POLITICIANS AND MILITARY LEADERS ARE FOR SALE, AND THEY'RE CHEAP, AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SELL THEIR NATION TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, THEY'RE DIRTY, AND THEY'RE INCOMPETENT. 

However, that doesn't go for the entire Pakistani population which, on the whole, is just suffering from decades of mismanagement by corrupt politicians and military, IN NO SMALL PART OWING TO BULLY NATIONS LIKE THE US who keep buying these politicians all the while despising those same Pakistani politicians and military leaders. Same as they feel about India and Indians whom they make a lot of jokes about behind their backs. The difference is that the Pakistani people, as evidenced by Imran Khan, aren't trying to impress the west, while India is doing some major boot-licking and shoe shining for Europe and the west, thinking that it's scoring points with them, but they will never accept Indians because deep down their leaders despise brown people, and always have. So India to them, is only good for killing other brown people and as long as India keeps doing that, by starting wars and creating more instability in the world, they'll smile and pat India's head and tell them, ""good dog.""

The breeding ground of terrorism that you speak of, that's on behalf of the western bully nations, NOT for or by the everyday population of Pakistan which, more often than not, suffer more due to these terrorists and their use by and against the unstable government and military leadership there. India is becoming the same type of bully nation, now threatening its neighbors with knee jerk reactions, trying to hide its decades long torture and mistreatment of the Kashmiri population, which is most likely the one who attacked them in the first place, fighting as they are, for their rights and against Indian government oppression.

More war is the last thing Asia or the world needs, and yet that's what India is now setting the stage for. And the old terrorist accusation to justify wars just doesn't hold up, we've seen the end result of that in Gaza. This accusation is just an excuse for war, nothing more.",@raykay72,0,1746921600,True,Ugw9XDl5s8Z9hWaXuh94AaABAg

Pakistan in the meantime, with its own illegitimate and corrupt political and military leadership, wants to divert attention away from the rightful and popular leader of Pakistan, Imran Khan, and his illegal incarceration. They're mistreating their own population with kidnappings and murders of its own population, all in a bid to stay in power, and so it's just business as usual for this corrupt political and rich (stolen money) class which has no shame and even less credibility. 

Its population though, contrary to the hindutva and indian nationalistic people's false accusations, isn't full of terrorists. That's just the usual cliche used by the fascist Indian regime, as it is by any government today when they want to go to war, and which is taking it direct from the Israeli playbook, used against the Palestinians, and we all know how that's ended up, in genocide of the victims who are accused of being terrorists apparently, even though Israel is being the most barbaric and sadistic out of all of them, but they like to call themselves ""most moral in the world."" 

So yeah, the fascist Indian government is creating more instability and wars in Asia and the world. Exactly what no one needs in this world.",@raykay72,0,1746921600,True,UgwQ16LUlTr-59c4xMJ4AaABAg

You're just using the Israeli zionist playbook of false narratives, and accusing everyone who doesnt' agree as being a terrorist. That's been normal for any government to do when it wishes to start a war as we're seeing in the genocide taking place in Gaza! 

The Indian government is an incompetent fascist regime, and the world is finding this out as they start learning more about them. All they've done is make Asia and the world even more unsafe and created more instability by starting wars. Asia and the world doesn't need more wars, and it certainly doesn't believe the stupid lies of pointing fingers and shouting ""terrorists!"" Everyone knows that this is just a poor excuse to justify wars!

But here’s what makes it surgical: the Pakistani fighter never even switched on its radar. The target was tracked entirely by a Pakistani AWACS, which fed live targeting data to the fighter. Once the lock was confirmed, the jet fired and immediately disengaged. The PL-15, screaming in at nearly Mach 4, covered the distance in just over 2 minutes — too fast and too far for the Rafale to respond. No warning, no radar lock, no chance.

Those who were behind the phalgram incident, they did that to use this incident as a catalyst to spread hatred and destroy peace, they are still at the win. They achieved what they wanted out of this, it's unfortunate but that's the fact.
If India is doing all this to avenge that phalgram incident then why they tried to destroy our neelum jhelum hydropower , that's so crucial for Pakistan, that's situated first in the water flow between Pak n india, this was the hidden agenda behind this so called terrorism war... shifting the focus of their people and world to hide the fact because now world focus is on terrorism but no one is talking about indus water treaty....
this all has started few months back when china and pakistan didn't allow india to build a water reservoir on himaliyas under the indus water treaty ( i can also provide proper facts if you are interested to know the complete story) then indian government needed some solid reasons to completely withdraw from that treaty. so this all drama has started due to water... this is war for water, not for terrorism...

Before Phalagham Jaffar train attack happened in Pakistan
They know Pakistan is mostly Muslim majority country and can't fight on religion, so create hatred between ethicities, they started to form militants based on ethnicity. Bla and TTP.

Bla did jaffer train attack ( 20+ terrorist) hijacked train and killed innocent passengers based on different ethnicities. Just  1month  before Phalagham attack. 
And India Media and ""Major Gaurav"" Former Indian Army personel openly were Laughing and Mocking The Jaffer train attack and were saying that they support those ( terrorist millitant) and they should do more to break Pakistan on the bases on Ethnicities 

Just 8 or 9 years before ( Indian Raw Agent Kalbushan Ydhav) was arrested From balochistan region of Pakistan who was involved in Terrors activities in Balochistan and Karachi city. 
He was Indian Naval Official , was working in Iran near Iran-Pak border and secretly enter go and forth between Iran and Pakistan , to carry out his plan. 
He funded Millitants to create separatist movement in Pakistan To divide Pakistan. Got arrested in Pakistan during the raid based on intelligence. 

Pakistan killed Terrorist of Jaffer train, instead of sending missiles/drone in India bcs Pak didn't want war.

Where Phalagham Attack Happned it's in Indian Occupied Kashmir ( Jammu Kashmir Jk) . 
Indian Kashmir is highly militerized zone in the world. But just before phalagham attack few months before they remove army personnel. 
From that place . 

The Attack where it happened is 4-5 hours drive from Pak border. 
4 terrorist( militants) attacked the tourist in 5-10 minutes and vanished ( Surprisingly) . 

In 5 minutes Complain written in police station of Phalagham which is 40 minutes away from that hilly area ( Surprisingly) 
And in 10 minutes Blame is on Pakistan.  Terrorist are still unknown and nowhere to be found. 

Then their Government Fuel the hatred target towards Pakistan that Pak did it.without proof

Pakistan Offered for Neutral Investigation from Other country but India didn't respond. And Broke indus Treaty and block the water which flow to Pakistan Indus rivers. 

Then after weeks Launched Missiles in the midnight in 3 cities ( Muzzarafarabad ( Azad Kashmir ) , Bawalpur   Kotli) . 
On mosque/civillian area 10+ People got killed including children and 30+ got severely injured. 
And Air combat happend with cause 2 Indian Rafel Jet destroyed, two Mig jets. 

Then 2nd night They sended Israeli made drones in more cities in near by Stadium ( where international match was helping) . 

And in 3rd night more Drones attacks. 

At night Pakistan Forces did press conference, India is is continuosly attacking and we will retaliate. 
And in early morning Pakistan retaliate with Missiles on there 3 Airbase. Causing damage 
Which shook them and Panic , they started press conference for Ceasefire. 

Then just after ceasefire they attack another drone on Airbase of Jamshoro city of Pakistan. 

And then suddly Trump tweet for ceasefire, so that Pakistan have no chance to respond.
