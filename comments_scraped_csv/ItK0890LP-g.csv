Humanitarian aid is not a transaction it’s an act of compassion, not a loan that demands loyalty in return.

Turkey, like any independent country, has the right to make its own foreign policy decisions, including supporting Pakistan or voicing its stance on Kashmir. International relations are based on principles and values, not on emotional blackmail. If your aid comes with strings attached, then it wasn’t humanitarian  it was political bargaining.

(3) zero-sum mindset (same as the Caucasian/Persian)

ps. My opinion on this is based on past supporting evidence, such as: (a) willingness to cooperate with the British India Company bosses to farm poppy plants and harvest opium without resistance but obedience, even when they know that the Sahib has a law that prohibits its consumption by Sahibs nor the locals in Indian; (2) When the Japanese during WW2 was invading South East Asia, the Indians of the region were willingly cooperating with the Japanese against the locals and indigenous peoples of the region (read the history of the Indian National Army (INA) and their leader Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent Indian nationalist,  which was supported by Imperial Japan. Bose formed the Provisional Government of Azad Hind even station himself and his army in South East Asia, which today is known as ASEAN.

If this is how Indian state machine works, it is really alarming for the country. When you boycott products and services from a specific country, you have to make sure that it will hurt the other side, so much so that they will be forced to change their behavior.

When you look at the figures, all is clear and such a boycott decision is foolish and childish. Here are the facts about the tourism sector in Turkiye.

Turkiye is one of the biggest tourist destinations in the world (top 5 in the world). In 2024, the country attracted about 65 million tourists. Indian tourists constitute not even 0.4% of the total. Also, last year Turkiye's tourism revenue was about 61 billion USD. The revenue from Indian tourists don't make up even 0.3% of the total. To put thing in perspective, only Istanbul attracts twice the number of tourists whole India gets in a year. Also, city of Antalya is visited by more tourists than whole India.

The only way for them to rule was promotion of hatred for Muslims in India which resulted in protests, movements to acquire a separate land even though bounded for growth and development by western powers.

Kashmir is a 70% Muslim populated land while Indians are taught that' its their land but reality is living people, their traditions, culture, religious beliefs make a land with a certain race in majority to elect their representatives. This is why Kashmir will not become part of India because people themselves refuse otherwise Pakistan could do nothing. Now Pakistan has regained some glory and Muslims states around the world are with it.

Ugx6TmgpvUWFFRoPibJ4AaABAg,"First, the speaker wants to begin by presenting himself as a humble learner of salah, collecting donations for a religious cause. Fine. No one denies the right to practice or promote religion. But within minutes, he pivots to an immature, sarcastic tirade against India—a sovereign, democratic nation—without offering a single credible geopolitical insight. Just performative rage.

Now let’s examine the first contradiction:
He ridicules India for reacting to Turkey’s support of Pakistan. But doesn’t that prove the point? That India isn’t weak? It reacts. It responds. It defends its diplomatic space. Whether it’s boycotts, travel advisories, or trade decisions, that’s strategic sovereignty—not cowardice. Every country does this. Just ask the West how they responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Or how Saudi Arabia responds to dissent. But when India does it, it becomes “hypocrisy”? Spare us.

Next, the mockery of India’s approach to China.
This is where ignorance meets oversimplification. India and China are two of the largest economies in the world. They’re neighbors with nuclear weapons. Their relationship involves trade, military standoff, diplomatic tension, and regional balance. It’s not an Instagram friendship you can just “cancel.” There’s a difference between tactical restraint and cowardice. Realpolitik is not decided by keyboard warriors.

And as for Turkey—yes, Turkey under Erdoğan has made pro-Pakistan statements. That’s nothing new. But here’s the difference: India doesn’t throw tantrums. It recalibrates relationships. Cancelling trips to Turkey? That’s a matter of national sentiment. Banning channels temporarily? That’s soft power signaling. It doesn’t prove insecurity—it proves that India knows how to message diplomatically, without firing a bullet.

Now comes the absurd claim that Turkey is “gaslighting” India by not even acknowledging the tensions. That’s not gaslighting. That’s Turkey trying to avoid worsening bilateral ties. You know what’s gaslighting? Accusing a democratic country of fascism for banning influencers while running PR for countries where journalists are jailed, women are stoned, and apostasy is punishable by death.

You complain about India banning influencers. Are you aware that the Pakistani government regularly bans social media apps, censors journalists, and arrests citizens under blasphemy laws? You celebrate Turkish military cooperation with Pakistan—but forget that Turkey itself is deeply polarized, jailing thousands of academics, purging military officials, and clamping down on dissent since the 2016 coup attempt. Want to talk about freedom?

Let’s get this straight: India is the world’s largest democracy, not a perfect one, but one that holds elections, has an independent judiciary, a raucous media, and more religious diversity than most Islamic countries combined. You’re criticizing it from a platform that depends on freedom of speech in the West—a right not even guaranteed in Pakistan or Turkey if you criticize the wrong things.

And this idea that India is somehow “crying” over Turkey?
No. It’s acting. Quietly, diplomatically, and proportionately. Boycotts aren’t tantrums—they’re non-violent pressure mechanisms. You know who throws tantrums? People who riot in the streets over cartoons. People who burn flags at the sight of a film. That’s not diplomacy. That’s immaturity.

Finally, the speaker ends with more mockery of Indian intelligence and press freedom. Again, irony writes its own rebuttal. If you’re going to mock a press ecosystem that’s loud, pluralistic, and occasionally messy, try doing that in China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey—and see how long your channel lasts.

So no—India isn’t “debased” or “disgraced.” It’s strategically managing multiple fronts with far more restraint and sophistication than the juvenile theatrics you seem to admire. If you want to critique India, by all means do it. But try it with facts, nuance, and a basic understanding of geopolitics—not a rant padded with sarcasm and social media memes. That’s not analysis. That’s infotainment dressed as indignation.",@Dasaanudasa108,0,1747353600,False,

UgzkjzstL-1_uUYXZJN4AaABAg,"Asalamu alaikum, brother — or should I say, the dollar-store Mufti Menk with a tripod and a WiFi grudge?”

You sit there, fake outrage in one hand and a keyboard in the other, pretending you're standing up to oppression while your own heroes jail cartoonists and ban journalists for tweeting too hard. But yes, go off, tell us how India — the largest democracy in the world — is somehow the tyrant here because we blocked a few propaganda channels.

And that smirk? Bro, you're not breaking news — you're breaking the patience of anyone with two functioning brain cells. You say India is “scared of China” — India stares down China in the Himalayas while your favorite countries flinch when someone frowns on Twitter. We send satellites to Mars. You send spicy tweets and call it foreign policy.

You mock us for boycotting Turkey? Let me break it down in words even your YouTube subscribers can digest:

> If a country arms the same enemy that sends bombs into our markets, trains terrorists across the border, and celebrates our dead — don’t expect us to send them mangoes and tour buses.



That’s not “fragile ego.” That’s called national spine. You wouldn’t know — yours has been outsourced to anyone who says “Long live Pakistan.”

And Erdogan’s tweet? You quote it like it’s Quranic revelation. Bro, the man said Hamas is freedom fighters and called Twitter a Western conspiracy. You quoting him like he’s Churchill only tells us one thing: You’re not informed. You’re just desperate for views from Islamabad to Istanbul.

And the whole “Indian media is trash” thing? Maybe. But here’s the difference: we can say that, tweet that, broadcast that — and not end up in a basement wearing a blindfold. You couldn’t speak half as freely in Turkey or Pakistan without someone asking you to “step outside for a quick chat.”

Now let’s talk IQ, since you brought it up. “Toilet brush IQ”? Bro, you rant like someone who failed debate club but passed delusion with flying colors. You’re not a journalist — you’re a TikTok ranter with better lighting.

Let me roast you real clear:

You say Turkey doesn't care about India's boycott — yet you made a 15-minute crying session over it. If they don’t care, why are you acting like a rejected prom date?

You claim India’s canceling trips is “hilarious” — and then beg viewers to keep flying to Turkey. Sounds like someone’s travel commission just took an L.

You say “India bans everyone.” Bro, your channel has more drama than a Pakistani soap opera and less truth than a WhatsApp forward.


And here's the fatal blow:

> India isn’t “oppressing Muslims” — India is standing up to foreign powers using religion to excuse arming enemies and funding instability.
You don’t defend Islam — you use it like a PR shield every time your arguments collapse under facts.



So thank you — sincerely. You’ve done what the entire Indian PR system couldn’t. You made the average Indian think, “Damn, if this is what anti-India propaganda looks like, we’re doing just fine.”

Now go back, edit your next video, and remember:
India doesn’t need to beg. India doesn’t need to explain. India just wins — while you whine in 1080p.

With all due respect, while I do agree with some of your points regarding the Indian government's and certain media outlets'(Jokers) divisive tactics for political gain, it's important to emphasize that when it comes to national security, we stand united with our country regardless of our internal differences.

As an Indian Muslim, I am genuinely hurt by your biased and prejudiced comments about the recent escalation between India and Pakistan.
 It's disheartening that there's no mention of the 26 innocent lives lost in the Pahalgam terror attack—an act carried out by The Resistance Front, a known offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba.

Being a Muslim doesn't mean automatically siding with any so-called Islamic country. What truly matters is standing for justice, truth, and humanity. Historically, it has often been provocations from Pakistan that have triggered conflict with India. I urge you to look at the facts and learn from history.

Imamoglu and Ozgur Ozel is trying to actually be an opposition(And their votes have reached the range of 35 - 40%) But now Imamoglu was arrested because Erdogan said so. Now they're trying to do the same to Ozgur Ozel as well. Erdogan is using every power he has over the state to remove them from the opposition and unable to speak.

This is why I am concerned. If things continue like this Erdogan will become another Aliyev, elections will be symbolic with no real opposition parties.",@notenlish,0,1747353600,True,Ugy3V5trhPk3On9qTTx4AaABAg

Ugy7A51zeH0w1NuQByR4AaABAg,"Asia is Egypt, Turks, Arabs, Israel, Persia, India.  It is Ancient India that is related to all. China is the Orient.  Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of Iran was India and it was rich, beautiful, and powerful. It was the Indian Prince known as the ""Buddha"" who colonized the Orient, created the Indo Pacific, because India was a non-violent empire, hence the Indian Ocean.  Today traitors  Afghanistan and Pakistan are a living hell.  Pakistan is a failed terrorist state. Pakistan has used terrorism against India before but this time India had no choice because other busy neighbors were getting involved.  Turkey and Pakistan should fighting for the genocide in  Palestine.  Turkey has no claims on Indian lands and should focus on the  shameful mess it has created in Syria and it's own internal unrest.  Muslim brotherhood? this is why you are being invaded by Africans. If you had higher thinking of ""Asian brotherhood"" then you would have known your history and have shame.  It was through economic trade within Asia, especially powerful India that the Ottoman, Persian, Greek, and later the British empire nonsense existed.  Through economic trade, knowledge flowed within ALL  of Asia.  Britain came in as false friends and when India realized she bravely ""Set the Sun"" on empire nonsense, like all other previous empire nonsense. It was the foolish Kings of Asian that brought in African slavery into Asia and later into South Asia.  China is the Orient, and like Genghis Khan, China's motto is ""you die, I live"" .  If you think China is going to help you, think again, when the USA finishes bombing you, China will take your lands.   The names, stories in the Old Testament are Asian, e.g. Sarai, Amir, Shemi (Indian)..   China claims that Taiwan is part of China and USA has no right.  China has NO rights on India's territory, history.  This is China's true ugly face!!  Orient China has been arming, like the USA, terrorist throughout Asia.  God/Creation said,  ""you are donkeys""  your hand is against everyone!!!.  You need to go to the Library and read a book. The Pharaoh's belief system was  rebirth, the Lotus Flower(the Indian Prince ""Buddha"") and the snake head gear over the third eye symbolizing primitive energy rising to enlightenment.  The Egyptians were small with Asian features, and blue entities. The west weaponized currency and faith.  You do not need to go through a European faith to Love Asian Christ.  Yeshiva was Jesus' real Jewish Asian name, Jesus was given to assimilate with the Greek deity Zeus.  India's original faith was scientific.  Torah/Bible  a entity talking from a cloud?  if this happened today 2025 you would be in awe but you would investigate not fall down and start worshiping.   Mecca a rock from the sky? Vedas flying machines before we knew how to fly?  Asia needs to go back to it's original scientific.
