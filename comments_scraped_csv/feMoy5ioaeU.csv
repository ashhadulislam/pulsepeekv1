Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan for 24years but the then Pakistani regime was so brutal, oppressive that we had our war of liberation in 1971 with 3million martyrs. My grandma( a mother of 4) was killed without any hesitation by west pak army. We grew up with this bitter, heartbreaking history for over 50years. But we choose to stand against Hindutva anytime. Bangladesh has more historical, cultural similarities with India than other country. We speak Bengali which mainly came from Sanskrit, our ethnicity is Bengali & India has 100million Bengali population in West Bengal, Bihar, Assam.

But this India isn't the India with whom we had close ties with. It's not the one with whom we shared similarities. It's becoming a hindutva fascist state with the destruction of glorious Muslim empires( Mughal, Sultanate). They're whitewashing the history in order to teach hate to the youngsters against muslims. The daily lync*hing of muslims, suppression against muslim institutions, destruction of historical mosques( Babri mosque & many more), waqf amendment & occupation of Kashmir are few of the reasons why we Bangladeshis choose to stand with Pakistan against Hindutva. We choose against our national wellbeing but for the benefit of our ummah. Hope Afghanistan choose the same path.

They say they had no idea what pakistani soldiers & politicians were doing & I couldn't but agree to them. Why? Because there were no source of news other than a few pakistani news portals which used to give narrative approved by the east Pakistan's government so possibility is there that the general people had no idea about the war. Secondly, what I see India has been doing to us. They have been torturing our people in the border areas, bullying us by calling kangladeshi, take all the benefits as if we are their state but don't even give us visa, negatively portray Bangladesh infront of the world & what not.

The War Clouds Are Over

By Iqbal Latif

Power, until tested, is revered. But when displayed unnecessarily, it exposes its own limits. That is the essence of deterrence: a strong leader must never swing the stick — unless certain that the blow will land precisely.

Modi had a big stick — the benefit of ambiguity, the fear of overwhelming force, and the rising global stature of India. But he used it — not for a calculated strike, but merely for a show of bravado. And in doing so, he revealed the hollowness of that power.

Now, the enemy no longer fears the stick.
Now, the world has seen that Indian airpower can be checked.
And Pakistan — the target of Modi’s strategic designs — has not emerged weakened, but awakened.
This was not just a strategic failure; it was a historic moment — when India lost its dominance not through defeat, but through overreach.

This was not a mere skirmish. It was an attempted redraw of the map of power and perception. But India’s strategy — intended to assert dominance — only ended up exposing its limitations. The Indian Air Force, long considered superior, was tested — and stopped. The stick meant to break Pakistan shattered mid-air.

Modi’s deeper plan was clear:
	1.	Provoke Pakistan into a nuclear overreaction,
	2.	Isolate it on the global stage,
	3.	Destroy its credibility.

But Pakistan didn’t blink.
It stood its ground with restraint, precision, and strategy.
Backed by Chinese ISR, radar, and missile networks, Pakistan turned potential defeat into regional balance.
	•	The myth of Rafale jets evaporated.
	•	INS Vikrant quietly withdrew.
	•	And India’s psychological dominance — its most potent weapon — was lost.

It was a trial of strength. And India showed its hand, shattering the illusion of superiority.
The Indian Air Force, once seen as invincible, has now been measured, weighed — and checked.
The entire framework of conventional superiority — built for a day like this — collapsed before the public eye.
	1.	The myth is broken.
	2.	Psychological dominance is gone.
	3.	And the dream of “Akhand Bharat” — wrapped in nationalist slogans — has washed away.

⸻

Pakistan’s Rendezvous with Destiny: From Brink to Brilliance

Last night will be remembered not for what happened — but for what didn’t:
	•	The “fall” of Islamabad,
	•	The “destruction” of Karachi Port,
	•	The “arrest” of General Asim Munir —
All were final attempts by Indian media to stage a theatrical illusion of victory — a drama of psychological conquest.

But it failed. And in that failure, a new reality emerged.

Today, as Modi looks north, he sees a restored alliance — Pakistan and China, closer than ever before.
This was Pakistan’s rendezvous with its history — an existential moment handled with dignity and precision.
The very jets India once mocked as “flying metal tubes” have redefined deterrence.

Pakistan showcased the most integrated defensive strategy and real-time coordination in modern South Asian military history.

And now, as India’s pride has been humbled, a new era begins — less of arrogance, more of humility.
The Arab world will no longer see Modi through the same lens.
Nor will Trump or the West.
Because they have seen the truth:
	1.	Pakistan stands at the crossroads of Karakoram, the Silk Road, Wagah, Khyber, and Torkham.
	2.	It holds not just geography, but the key to regional stability for 2.8 billion people.
	3.	The strategic map has shifted — and so has the world’s perspective.

⸻

Strategic Forecast: Modi’s Miscalculation and the Dawn of a New Balance

What began as a show of strength has become a textbook example of strategic error.
Modi’s goal was clear:
	1.	Assert dominance, humiliate Pakistan swiftly, and cement India’s regional supremacy.
The plan relied on Indian Air Force superiority, Rafale jets, INS Vikrant, satellite intelligence, and political swagger.
	2.	In Modi’s mind, the war was 99% won — only one final strike remained.

But the illusion shattered the moment Indian jets entered contested airspace.
Air dominance was lost not to firepower — but to something more complex: deep, real-time coordination between Pakistan and China.

Pakistan Air Force didn’t just have radars — it had eyes in space:
Chinese ISR satellites, Saab Erieye AWACS, and the PL-15 long-range air-to-air missile formed a net no Indian jet could escape.

As India moved its airpower to forward “Tiger” bases — Pakistan was watching.
PAD systems monitored silently.
And once IAF jets took off, only those who fired weapons were targeted.
Rafale pilots? According to several reports, they never even saw the missile coming.
Because with AWACS guidance, the PL-15 becomes a phantom — killing before it’s seen.

This wasn’t an air battle. It was a networked ambush.

At sea, too, the illusion fell apart.
INS Vikrant, India’s flagship carrier, was forced to retreat after radar locking by a Pakistani P-3C Orion —
A surgical humiliation, not with missiles, but with tracking and restraint.

This signaled a new deterrent reality:
India can be seen.
It can be followed.
And it can be stopped.

Modi’s dream — to “erase” Pakistan, divide it, dry its rivers, destroy its cities —
Is now just a relic of a past fantasy.

⸻

Global Impact

Pakistan, long branded a “failing state,”
has emerged as a reliable balancer.

Not an economic giant, nor a second-tier player —
But a nation that stopped the Indian Air Force,
and proved that defense isn’t about quantity — it’s about precision.

This isn’t just a strategic shift — it’s a psychological jolt.

The Islamic world, once hesitant,
now looks at Pakistan through a new lens —
For in modern warfare, respect isn’t earned through slogans, but through credible deterrence.

Indian media, which spent the night fantasizing about a “victory parade” in Islamabad,
woke up to embarrassment and silence.

From Zee News to Times Now — the dream was over.
Influencers issued apologies.
Tweets were deleted.
Senior Indian analysts began calling for accountability.

⸻

My Forecast:
	1.	Modi will retreat.
Not because he wants to — but because he has no choice.
	2.	What was imagined as a “surgical strike” has turned into a technical, political, and ideological defeat.
	3.	The India–Pakistan conflict is no longer unilateral —
It is now a regional balance of power shaped not by drama,
but by the depth of the Pakistan–China military alliance.

This was not just a blow to Modi —
It was a strategic gift to Pakistan —
Given by the very man who sought to destroy it.

He paved the way —
And now that path has become the new reality.

The curtain has lifted.
The balance has shifted.
The myth has died.

Modi — once hailed as the architect of a “New India,”
once heard with thunderous applause on global stages —
now stands in the shadow of a rising counterbalance.

Pakistan, once dismissed as a failed state —
now enjoys the tacit strategic support of China’s Western Theater Command —
a guarantee of territorial integrity in any future conflict.

The balance of power has permanently shifted.

The dream of “Akhand Bharat” is over.
The belligerent posture is gone.

It’s time the Indian public accepts the truth
that their media won’t tell them:
Pakistan is no longer the Pakistan of old —
It cannot be ignored.

Today’s PAF — dignified, precise, and confident —
is not the conduct of a failing state.
It is the face of a nation that has held the line —
and redrawn it with strength.

Let us now pursue peace —
by recognizing each other’s capabilities and dignity.
It is vital we engage with mutual respect, patience, and understanding —
not with arrogance or ignorance.

UgyEPK5O9KwYRAdNBt54AaABAg,"After gaining independence, India carried out a series of military invasions and territorial occupations:

In 1947–48, it took 16,309 sq miles of Jammu & Kashmir.

In 1948, it annexed 3,337 sq miles of Junagadh.

The same year, 82,698 sq miles of Hyderabad was taken by force.

In 1961, Goa was invaded and 1,429 sq miles absorbed.

In 1971, it split East Pakistan, seizing 57,320 sq miles.

In 1975, it annexed Sikkim, another 2,740 sq miles.

That’s a total of 162,405 square miles captured through military action—more land than the entire area of Germany or Poland.

Yet somehow, the Indian narrative still paints itself as a “peaceful” and “non-violent” nation. What a joke.

No modern state has used military aggression to occupy so much territory while pretending to be the world's moral compass.

And now you want to give lectures to other countries?

First, look at your own house. BJP and their saffron mob have turned India into a hate machine—mosques demolished, minorities lynched, voices silenced, students jailed, and anyone speaking truth branded “anti-national.”

Your feku chaiwala PM, who’s better at posing with peacocks than leading a democracy, has let extremist ideology hijack the nation.

I used to wonder how can someone only tell lies... like all the time? how even. well now I realize the examples were just around the corner this whole time lol. and about their courage, yes they don't fear Allah one bit and have zero self realization over anything. honestly, the only reason they scare me is because I can see them, realizing that's exactly how people are without the pity of Allah and the hidayat of Allah. I'm nobody to make such comments but it does strike a fear in my heart that if I, or anyone, was that arrogant, I'd have been as stupid as them without even realizing it. scary stuff. but anyways, just like Israel, India have exposed themselves to the global media. that's nice. then again, I'm only gonna choose Muslims and mu'mins over india or Pakistan. only mu'mins are promised victory and they are the most righteous.

Ugy61mJk7H2VjCZ0K0J4AaABAg,"To those asking why Afghans support India 🇮🇳 over Pakistan 🇵🇰 in times of conflict, let me make this clear: our issue is not with the people of Pakistan, but with the Pakistani military and political establishment which for decades has acted as an enemy to the Afghan nation, despite pretending to be a “Muslim neighbor.”

Let’s look at history and facts:
	1.	Sanctuary for destruction: After 9/11, it was Pakistan that gave military bases to the United States to launch airstrikes on Afghanistan, leading to the death of over 1 million innocent Afghans. While Afghans were burning under bombs, Pakistan was earning dollars in return.
	2.	Safe haven for terrorism: The Pakistani military openly harbored and supported the Taliban and other extremist groups who killed our teachers, our doctors, our children, and destroyed our progress. Even Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, not Kabul.
	3.	Strategic depth policy: Pakistan has treated Afghanistan as its “backyard” under its evil “strategic depth” doctrine, creating instability and chaos so that Afghanistan could never stand on its feet.
	4.	Violation of Islamic brotherhood: Islam teaches us not to betray your neighbor and not to support oppressors. The Qur’an says: “Do not incline toward the oppressors, lest you be touched by the Fire…” (Surah Hud, 11:113). What Pakistan did to Afghanistan is nothing but betrayal and oppression—from supporting the Taliban to sending spies, bombs, and fake peace.
	5.	Durand Line oppression: They are still fencing the illegal Durand Line, dividing Afghan families, and killing innocent Afghans with cross-border shelling—even as we extend the hand of peace.

So yes, many Afghans support India—not because India is perfect or because we are against Muslims, but because India has never sent suicide bombers to our mosques, never funded terrorists against us, and never tried to enslave our nation through proxy war.

Until the Pakistani establishment stops treating Afghanistan as its colony and stops exporting terror in the name of Islam, the Afghan people will stand with those who respect our sovereignty, whether they are Muslim or not.",@Abdullah_tee,1,1747180800,False,

The only consistent thing in Islamic history is that Muslim nations have spent more time fighting each other than uniting. From the Rashidun civil wars to the Ottoman-Safavid conflicts, to today’s Sunni-Shia proxy battles in Yemen and Syria — “ummah” unity has always been more theatre than theology.

Pakistan banking on “Muslim brotherhood” for financial bailouts is like a student who fails every exam and then expects his classmates to pay his tuition — because they went to the same school.

As for the Arab world, they’ve moved on. The Gulf states are now signing deals with India, investing in technology, trade, and infrastructure. Why? Because real nations invest in growth, not in exporting tired victim narratives.

And Turkey? Erdoğan’s inflation is in double digits, the lira has been sinking faster than the Titanic, and Ankara is busy cozying up to Russia and China out of desperation — not strength.

So if you’re going to invoke “ummah unity” as your economic strategy, at least update the PowerPoint — because the rest of the world sees right through the performance.",@Dasaanudasa108,1,1747180800,True,Ugz87Mg0xjnseDLNxQ14AaABAg

Illegal Bangladesh is just an excuse to persecute Indian muslims who don't even speak Bengali. Moreover Bangladesh has 2million illegal Indians in our nothern districts & districts in the border. Bangladeshi hindus have many relatives in west bengal who are indian bengali hindus which is why having Indian hindus here is much common.

He is very informed about political situation in South, Central and West Asia but strategically keeps quiet bc he does not want to criticize Pakistani govt, which has been receiving Billions from the US to terrorize Muslims and hand over innocent ppl to the US to be tortured in Guantanomo Bay. Plenty of media reported about the forced expulsions and how the PAK govt demolished housing of Afghan refugees and imprisoned them and demanded that they pay money before they could exit PAK as they were forced to leave and then capped how much money they could take with them. They were not allowed to take vehicles, animals, tractors, etc. They kicked out ppl who had  been born in PAK and lived their whole live there, some even only speaking Urdu. The expulsions are ongoing as we speak. No, the Muslim community is silent on this issue but now he wants to criticize all Afghans just bc some of them made online comments. Ppl supporting PAK need to accept the many criticism ppl have against the govt, even from Pakistanis themselves. My point is if you are going to ignore the abuse by the PAK govt against Afghans for decades and ongoing issues, then it is pretty hypocritical (and nationalistic) of you to complain about some Afghan ppl's online comments critical of the Pakistani govt. You should just focus on the India - Pakistan issue and ignore online comments of a few Afghan ppl, which has no bearing on the conflict anyway, and you would not malign all Afghans in that manner either.

And you are detracting from the main issue that started this war: The Pahalgam attack that killed 26 innocent Hindus. Terrorists from Pakistan murdered them after questioning whether they were Hindus. Does India have no right to retaliate?

Pakistan has been harboring and protecting terrorists, and you want people to believe that India started the war?

Mainstream media like the BBC, CNN, the New York Times, MSNBC, thr Washington Post, et cetera, have been spreading false narratives, misinformation/disinformation since 2015.

They have an agenda to program people into believing that Black folk are superior to all other races. And it is my opinion that the only reason they defend Islam is because many Black people are of the Islamic faith.

I do not approve of extremist Hindu views. There are good Muslims and bad Hindus, and there are bad Muslims and good Hindus.

It's distasteful when you present all Muslims as being good, and all Hindus as being bad. Shame on you.

If terrorists attacked the United States, their administration would go to war with whichever nation they think is harboring said terrorists.

Remember Pearl Harbor? Remember what Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan did which instigated World War II?

I dare anyone to say that Allied countries started World War II.

India is merely doing what Allied forces did: Responding to terrorists. Spare me and everyone else your bigotry toward India, and pro-Pakistan viewpoints, that very same Pakistan which has been giving shelter to terrorists since the partition happened.

Ugx8qgR9VOmyfDPTFXl4AaABAg,"Indian achievements in this 4 day conflict:
 - took down 9 terrorist camps in Pakistan and POK and neutralised terrorists
 - attacked and destroyed multiple airbases after provacation
 - defended against 100s of UAV and drones
 - defended against Fatah missile (probably headed towards New Delhi)
 - showed the efficiency of S-400 and Akash air defence systems (where as pakistan's HQ - 9 failed to detect and defend against indian attacks just as expected)
 - tested Brahmos supersonic missiles on Pak soil successfully ( this already has a 100% efficiency, so no doubts necessary)
 - did not give a chance for the PAF to enter Indian airspace ( info publicy disclosed)
 - showed her deplomatic efficiency.


Pakistan claims / achievements (honestly they did not achieve anything except in their news channels and anti - India news channels):
  - Rafale jet taken down (which India neither agreed nor denied to)
  - sent turkish drones (come on bruh, sending drones and UAVs does not mean that they are successful)

Let us assume that that Pakistan did take down the Rafale . When was that. AFTER THE IAF SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR MISSION. One might ask What their defense systems were  doing. IApparently they were sleeping.

If you are still reading this, let me add few conspiracies but thinkable points. 
 - Pak begged US for a ceasefire threatening to use nuclear weapons. 
 - There were 4 magnitude earthquakes during this incidents. Were they naturally occured ones or due to the nuclear testing from PAK. 
 - Why did USA send an aircraft to monitor nuclear readings. Are all these points interlinked.
 - Pak fired in Kashmir after the ceasefire agreement. Reports suggested that China was disappointed to see USA brokered this deal and pissed at Pakistan to prefer USA to go and ask for the deal. They say that pak breached the agreement to embarass Trump after this agreement.
 - Western news outlets are pointing out only Rafale incident (which again IAF neither denied nor agreed to) to promote negativity against Rafale which makes other countries not prefer Dassault and go for Lockheed Martin and other friendly country's jets.

Pakistan’s support was crucial for the Afghan Mujahideen — they provided training, weapons (via the CIA), and safe havens.

➡ Without Pakistan's help:

The Mujahideen might have failed to resist the USSR effectively.

The Soviet Union could have remained in Afghanistan longer or even succeeded in creating a puppet regime.

The Cold War might’ve tilted in favor of the Soviets in South Asia.

🔹 2. Refugee Crisis
Over 5 million Afghan refugees crossed into Pakistan since 1979.

➡ Without Pakistani shelter:

Iran and Central Asia would have faced enormous pressure.

Humanitarian crises would’ve worsened.

The Pashtun population distribution would have been drastically different.


🔹 3. Regional Power Balance
Pakistan’s involvement shaped not just Afghan history, but India-Pakistan dynamics too.

India might have had more influence in Afghanistan.

To save both Afghanistan and Pakistan from indiscriminate areal bo..bing that could've resulted in far greater loss of civilian life in both countries, Musharraf provided bases and ground access to US troops which reduced the intensity of areal bo..bing and brought the war to ground. At the same time, Musharraf provided covert aid to taleban fighters that eventually resulted in US troops expulsion from Afghanistan. It was that ingenious strategy of Musharraf that led American thinktanks to publish lengthy articles blaming US defeat in Afghanistan squarely on Musharraf and his ""double game"".

Also, fact is Islam does not allow us Muslims to be cowards  if we want to fight a war we will do it openly and to defend ourselves and our ummah! This is Islam! There are conditions of war protocol which need to be fulfilled when going to war and killing innocent civilians is not NOT our way! That won’t be proof for you but that’s how we function! You will get traitors who are not Muslim. Our chapri minister revealed on cnn they been doing the usa’s dirty work for last three decades so that should be proof.

Ugx3JAcboqt0nnC2x5x4AaABAg.AI1n39iKnXDAI6CDljxlom,"You claim to follow Islam, yet you defend a state that committed mass murder, sexual violence, and ethnic cleansing against fellow Muslims? Here’s what your religion actually says—read it and reflect.”

Qur’an 5:32

> ""...if anyone kills a person unless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entirely...""
Pakistan didn’t kill one they killed millions. They executed unarmed civilians, doctors, students, and scholars.



Qur’an 24:2 – on unlawful sexual acts:

> ""The woman and the man guilty of zina, flog each one of them with a hundred stripes...""
Pakistani soldiers violated over 200,000 Bengali Muslim women during the war. No justice. No punishment. And you want to forgive that?



Sahih al-Bukhari on war conduct:

> ""Do not kill children or women, or the elderly or sick.""
Yet in 1971, they shot pregnant women in the stomach, bayoneted babies, and burned families alive in villages like Chuknagar and Shankharipara. These are war crimes forbidden in Islam.



Qur’an 4:135  about being just even against fellow Muslims:

> ""Be just: that is nearer to piety...""
Calling them “Muslim brothers” does not make them innocent. Islam commands justice, not blind loyalty.



And you still think supporting them is Islamic? Then where is your outrage when they fabricated propaganda to justify genocide? Where is your disgust when they denied it ever happened? That’s hypocrisy. That’s munafiq behavior.

Qur’an 2:11–12:

> ""And when it is said to them, ‘Do not cause corruption on the earth,’ they say, ‘We are but reformers.’ Verily, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive it not.""

So no, don’t hide behind religion to defend those who betrayed every Islamic value. If you truly fear Allah, then stop supporting evil. Stop rewriting history. Stop shaking hands with those who once held guns to our mothers’ heads.

Ugx3JAcboqt0nnC2x5x4AaABAg.AI1n39iKnXDAI3gAX74f52,"Bangladesh has valid, historically documented reasons to remain wary of forging close ties with Pakistan, stemming from the systematic genocide committed by the Pakistani military during the 1971 Liberation War. According to declassified documents, international journalists, and the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report, the Pakistani Army and its collaborators were responsible for the mass killing of an estimated 300,000 to 3 million people, including students, intellectuals, scientists, and civilians, and the violation of approximately 200,000 to 400,000 women, as reported by the UN and the Bangladeshi government. Targeted massacres took place in places like Dhaka University, where intellectuals and students were brutally executed. On March 25, 1971, during ""Operation Searchlight,"" the Pakistani military initiated a campaign to silence Bengali demands for autonomy by launching one of the most violent crackdowns in South Asian history. Entire villages were burned, women were taken to camps and subjected to inhumane abuse, and newborns were murdered in front of their families. These acts were not collateral damage of war, they were calculated. The Pakistani state explicitly denied Bengali identity, suppressed the Bengali language, and sought to maintain dominance by terrorizing the population into submission. The victims were predominantly Muslim, revealing that religious identity was no shield against ethnic and linguistic persecution. To this day, Pakistan has not officially apologized for the atrocities of 1971. Many war criminals were protected or later integrated into Pakistani politics. There is a persistent lack of remorse, justice, or reconciliation from the Pakistani state, which Bangladeshis view as a refusal to acknowledge the blood on its hands. Therefore, any political or social attempt to normalize relations with Pakistan without accountability undermines the memory of the victims, the sacrifices of the Mukti Bahini, and the very foundation of Bangladeshi independence. Friendship cannot be built on denial, silence, or historical amnesia.

Ugx3JAcboqt0nnC2x5x4AaABAg.AI1n39iKnXDAI2V1v8WQou," @Argus_The_DarkAngel  That’s a sweet sentiment—but let’s come back down to Earth for a moment.

If by “revelation” you mean a handful of emotional online posts, that’s not a diplomatic shift—it’s a Twitter mood swing. Bangladesh–Pakistan relations are still diplomatically cold, and no amount of wishful slogans changes that. Bangladesh hasn’t forgotten the 1971 genocide, when over 3 million Bangladeshis were killed and thousands of women raped by the Pakistani military. To this day, Pakistan has never officially apologized, and Bangladeshis still commemorate the Liberation War every year with pride and pain. That history is not erased by a few online “brother” comments.

Economically, diplomatically, and strategically, Bangladesh is closely aligned with India, and that hasn’t changed. You can’t wish away deep economic integration, joint border coordination, and regional security partnerships with a paragraph of sentiment. There’s no “uprising.” There’s no strategic pivot. There’s no evidence of Bangladesh cutting ties with India, rejecting trade, or signing security agreements with Pakistan. That’s not how statecraft works.

You say “India can’t control anything about Bangladesh”—but nobody said it does. Bangladesh is a sovereign nation. But sovereignty doesn’t mean aligning yourself with a collapsing state apparatus like Pakistan’s, which is lurching from one economic crisis to another, and where even basic governance is under strain. Aligning with Pakistan “without hesitation” isn’t loyalty—it’s strategic blindness.

Brotherhood is beautiful when it’s grounded in reality. But slogans don’t feed people, secure borders, or build futures. Bangladesh’s prosperity has come from independence, economic growth, regional stability, and smart diplomacy—not emotional alliances with militaries who once turned Dhaka into a graveyard.

So yes, may you have a great day too—but preferably with your eyes open.",@Dasaanudasa108,0,1747180800,True,Ugx3JAcboqt0nnC2x5x4AaABAg

UgzBxgAPnu2mEyX5TZF4AaABAg.AI1x1_rEAKmAI3FBX0o3mC," @adawg9533  To those asking why Afghans support India over Pakistan in times of conflict, let me make this clear: our issue is not with the people of Pakistan, but with the Pakistani military and political establishment—which for decades has acted as an enemy to the Afghan nation, despite pretending to be a “Muslim neighbor.”

Let’s look at history and facts:
	1.	Sanctuary for destruction: After 9/11, it was Pakistan that gave military bases to the United States to launch airstrikes on Afghanistan, leading to the death of over 1 million innocent Afghans. While Afghans were burning under bombs, Pakistan was earning dollars in return.
	2.	Safe haven for terrorism: The Pakistani military openly harbored and supported the Taliban and other extremist groups who killed our teachers, our doctors, our children, and destroyed our progress. Even Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, not Kabul.
	3.	Strategic depth policy: Pakistan has treated Afghanistan as its “backyard” under its evil “strategic depth” doctrine, creating instability and chaos so that Afghanistan could never stand on its feet.
	4.	Violation of Islamic brotherhood: Islam teaches us not to betray your neighbor and not to support oppressors. The Qur’an says: “Do not incline toward the oppressors, lest you be touched by the Fire…” (Surah Hud, 11:113). What Pakistan did to Afghanistan is nothing but betrayal and oppression—from supporting the Taliban to sending spies, bombs, and fake peace.
	5.	Durand Line oppression: They are still fencing the illegal Durand Line, dividing Afghan families, and killing innocent Afghans with cross-border shelling—even as we extend the hand of peace.

So yes, many Afghans support India—not because India is perfect or because we are against Muslims, but because India has never sent suicide bombers to our mosques, never funded terrorists against us, and never tried to enslave our nation through proxy war.

Until the Pakistani establishment stops treating Afghanistan as its colony and stops exporting terror in the name of Islam, the Afghan people will stand with those who respect our sovereignty, whether they are Muslim or not.",@Abdullah_tee,0,1747180800,True,UgzBxgAPnu2mEyX5TZF4AaABAg

And he who is killed under the banner of a man who is blind (to the cause for which he is fighting), who gets flared up with family pride and fights for his tribe is not from my Ummah, and whosoever from my followers attacks my followers (indiscriminately) killing the righteous and the wicked of them, sparing not (even) those staunch in faith and fulfilling not his obligation towards them who have been given a pledge (of security), is not from me (i.e. is not my follower)."" - Sahih Muslim 1848c

“There will be callers at the gates of Hell; whoever responds to them they throw them into it.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, describe them to us.” He said: “They will be from our people, speaking our language.” I said: “What do you command me to do, if I live to see that?” He said: “Adhere tothe main body of the Muslims and their leader. If there is no such body and no leader, then withdraw from all their groups, even if you bite onto the trunk of a tree until death finds you in that state.” - Sunan Ibn Majah 3979

Yes, some people especially older generations or rural communities may follow fake pirs out of a lifelong habit.

Surah Al-An'am 6:159:
""Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you, [O Muhammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allah ; then He will inform them about what they used to do"". This verse emphasizes that those who form sects are not the responsibility of the Prophet and their actions will be judged by God. 

Surah Ali 'Imran 3:103:
""And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah, and do not become divided"". This verse is a direct call for unity and against fragmentation within the Muslim community. 

Surah Ali 'Imran 3:104:
""And do not be like those who split and differed after clear proofs had come to them"". This verse warns against the dangers of division after the clear guidance of God has been revealed.",@zuzina0,0,1747353600,True,Ugy-DWvBajmO0RF4mlx4AaABAg

Nomadic Arab tribes became partially settled communities and some of them lived within walled towns practised agriculture and commerce, wroteon wood and stone, feared the gods and honored the kings.”

People really need to stop confusing fame with intelligence. If you actually look at how Imran Khan talks and the kind of decisions he’s made ,he sounds like he’s just winging it. He says stuff without thinking it through and makes choices that make you question if he even understands the consequences.

I get it, the army shouldn’t be involved in literally everything. But that doesn’t automatically mean whatever Imran Khan says or does is right just because it’s civilian rule. he’s not some kind of savior. Truth is, he’s just as corrupt as the others, even worse. And again, being popular doesn’t mean you’re sane or that your decisions are good for the country.

Take the Abhinandan situation in 2019. India had just crossed into Pakistani airspace, was about to airstrike, but we captured their pilot. Pakistan had the upper hand, But what did IK do? He sends the guy back within 48hrs like we were the ones trying to apologize. Shamelessy called it a peace gesture,. India got to walk away looking like the mature side while we handed over the only leverage we had.

If that situation was handled more strategically, we might’ve gotten something out of it, or at least not looked like we folded under pressure. 
If it this entire situation was fully up to Imran Khan without any pushback, who knows what he would’ve done? Either he’d have made things ten times worse by saying something reckless, or he’d embarrass Pakistan again by acting like we were desperate for peace.

You are blaming Imran Khan as corrupt, Really Mr? Seems you have one sided hate and jealousy from one person because he stood up against the corrupt mafia and exposed all the puppets behind the scenes

Imran Khan the one who has led this nation to a world Cup victory, built shaukat khanam for millions of people and saved millions of lives, built namal Islamic university being the first university to properly train the students in islamic Studies as well as in their professional life, not just this but he came into politics to fix his country and to eliminate the corrupt system being imposed on us, if Imran Khan is corrupt why he has so much support and a massive popularity among the public

Imran Khan didnt want the war to be escalated, that's why he went for peace instead of fighting and again martyring his own country men, he is such an honorable person

By the way your Government has already handed the Indian soldier to India because of pressure, now answer me you were saying that Imran Khan did make a weak decision, seriously bro you people are literally clowns,Shabaz is just a puppet of Modi, now do not run away, stand and give facts because you cant, as facts are harder to digest

Moreover in the era of Imran Khan, economy become better, overseas Pakistan began investing in Pakistan and that contributed significantly in Pakistan economy. He was trust able partner in eyes of world that's why he is respected in world, not like Shabaz or Maryam or Nawaz or any Army General which even USA Government shames and abuses them, they also know how to respect the one which stands with the country and how to treat the one which is their slave

In the era of Imran Khan not a single drone was reported, no civilian casualties, barely a terror attack, now look how many terrrorist attack have occurs in the Army regime implanted now onwards

Not a single country is now with Pakistan and is willing to invest in our country, even Saudi also call Pakistan a beggar, your PM Shahbaz himself said that Beggars can't be choosers

UgzDFqKpNcjGwxKsg1F4AaABAg,"The idea of a “Greater Israel” — meaning Israel expanding to control all territory from the Nile to the Euphrates — is not the official policy of the State of Israel, nor is it supported by most Israelis or the Israeli government.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. The “Greater Israel” Myth:
	•	Antisemites and anti-Zionists often claim that Israel seeks to conquer large parts of the Middle East, citing a misinterpretation of biblical texts or extremist fringe views.
	•	In reality, the vast majority of Israeli Jews, including mainstream politicians, do not support such an idea.
	•	The Israeli Declaration of Independence supports peaceful coexistence and never mentions “expanding borders.”

2. Who does support it?
	•	Only fringe ideological groups (like some religious extremists or Kahanist-type figures) dream of “Greater Israel.”
	•	These groups have no real power in Israeli politics, and their views are rejected by most Israeli Jews, including secular, religious-Zionist, and centrist communities.

3. Reality:
	•	Israel has actually given up land for peace (like Sinai to Egypt, Gaza disengagement in 2005).
	•	Its real strategic interest is security, not imperial expansion.
	•	Even Netanyahu and Likud, considered right-wing, have never made “Greater Israel” an official platform.

4. Why this lie is pushed:
	•	To demonize Israel and compare it to colonial empires.
	•	It feeds pan-Arabist and Islamist narratives that paint Israel as a regional aggressor rather than a state defending its existence.

So no — Israel does not seek a “Greater Israel”, and saying so is propaganda, not fact.",@Taqifshabythenedhepidhin,0,1747267200,False,

If Iran’s fingerprints are found on any missile strike, India will not back down. We are a superpower, and we will defend our land, our people, and our honor. No one can threaten us without facing the wrath of our might.",@INGOBRO,0,1747267200,True,UgytDCOzay_6OQxPLIB4AaABAg

Pakistan plays war on WiFi — not the battlefield.
Every time there's tension with India, they rush to Twitter, Telegram, and TikTok, not the frontlines. Why? Because they know they can’t win a real war, so they build castles out of lies on the internet.

They've poured money into fake news factories, hired keyboard warriors, and run bot armies to scream “victory” online — even when their jets are falling from the sky.
Their soldiers get buried, but their hashtags trend. That’s Pakistan’s style.

They spend on propaganda, not soldiers — and their main targets are gullible youth, foreign media, and sometimes even confused Indians.
It’s all about photo ops, fake videos, and flashy headlines. Behind the screen, it's just chaos and failure.

Meanwhile, India doesn't need to bark online — because truth speaks louder than their filtered fiction.

He was a legendary ruler who united many lands under Dharma, strength, and knowledge. Because of his legacy, the land came to be known as “Bharatvarsha” — the realm of Bharata.

This name is not just a label — it's a symbol of civilizational pride. It reflects our own identity, rooted in Sanatan dharma, culture, and history. Even our Constitution begins with:
“India, that is Bharat…”

The regions now called Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and even the Maldives were once part of ancient Bharat, united under powerful Hindu empires and bound by the same civilization, language roots, and culture.

Over centuries, this land was invaded, divided, and stolen — first by foreign Islamic invaders, then by British colonizers, and finally broken through the forced Partition of 1947, which tore our civilization apart. Indians never chose this division — it was imposed.

That’s why the call for Akhand Bharat is not about aggression — it’s about reclaiming what was ours, what was taken from us through bloodshed, deceit, and foreign politics. It’s a demand born from memory, pain, and truth. Our land wasn’t divided naturally — it was broken.

In 1947, after India and Pakistan became independent, the ruler of Kashmir (a Hindu king of a Muslim-majority state) wanted to stay independent.

But Pakistan sent tribal fighters to invade Kashmir on October 22, 1947. This was the first act of occupation.

In response, the Maharaja asked India for help and legally joined India by signing the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947. Indian troops then pushed back the invaders.

Even though they made some unpopular decisions, their goal was always to help get the invaders out which they ultimately did. Don't forget that the Americans were carrying out indiscriminate b.bings of Afghanistan during the first phase of invasion using b..mbs as big as the ones used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Refusal to assist Americans could've resulted in much greater loss of civilian lives in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, not to mention the loss of Pakistan infant nuclear assets, so Gen. Musharraf made the tough decision to provide passage to American troops while covertly helping Afghan freedom fighters as well as providing a safe haven to fleeing Afghan civilians.

WA/Alaikum Assalam and namaste 🙏 
Both have a beautiful meaning. 

Was listening to you, 
What modi meant was not Pakistan attack themselves.
He was clearly saying instead of supporting india against terrorism pakistan has sides terrorismand have attacked back on India.

Well but if modi really was attacking terrorists did it communicate well with Pakistan Govt that support us to end terrorism no instead india itself started acting like one huge terrorist country 

So it’s a lack of communication a good communication between two nations as always and rest benefit from it. Sadly.

This rise in political hostility has raised concerns about growing intolerance and the erosion of civil discourse.

There are also real safety and crime issues that affect public perception, especially among tourists. They will hijack your wife or gf and gone with them, One villain kill a tourist for his wife, can you believe this?

Reports of harassment, scams, and fraud—such as tech support scams targeting foreign retirees—have contributed to a negative image in some circles. These scams, often run from call centers, falsely claim to be Microsoft or antivirus support and aim to extract money from unsuspecting victims.

Incidents like the 26/11 attacks, the Kargil War, the Parliament attack, and the Uri strike—where countless innocent lives were lost, including Muslims—are stark reminders of the terrorism India has endured. Most of these attacks were carried out by Pakistan-based terrorist groups, yet India consistently chose diplomatic responses for years.

However, when diplomacy failed to stop the bloodshed, targeted counter-terrorism operations were necessary and justified. These were not random acts of aggression but precise strikes on known terror camps.

If fairness is the goal, then why ignore what the Pakistani military did to fellow Muslims in Bangladesh in 1971? Or the ongoing human rights violations against the Baloch people? India, home to more Muslims than Pakistan, remains a diverse and democratic society where Muslims hold key political and social roles.

UgxES8wf1pmKaHLT3pB4AaABAg,"Just who is this blind deaf condemned servant in Isaiah 42:18-20? Christians and Muslims both agree that Isaiah makes it clear that the servant of condemnation is none other than the nation of Israel: Who is blind like the one in covenant with me, blind like the servant of the Lord? [Isaiah 42:19]

“one in covenant with me” is a clear reference to the nation of Israel who were in covenant with God at the time Isaiah made this prophecy. Isaiah goes on to make it even more explicit: Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? [Isaiah 42:24]


Numbers 23:19 ""GOD is not a human male—he doesn't lie, nor is he a human being—he never vacillates. Once he speaks up, he's going to act, isn't he? Once he makes a promise, he'll fulfill it, won't he?

📖 Isaiah 42:21 ""The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law and make it honorable."" Question: How did the Jewish and Christians's God magnify Law to make people righteous ⁉️



Isaiah 42: (1-17) describe a momentous servant (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) in extremely positive terms, one who will be a “light for the Gentiles”(see 42:6), will rise from Madina (see 42:11) to free people from darkness of idols worships by fighting against injustice (polythesim) to guide the blind (42:16) to establish justice on earth 🌎 (see 42:4) with a new law (see 42:21).


Because 'The nation of Israel' is condemned as blind deaf in Isaiah 42:19,24 for rejecting Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), the guiding servant in Isaiah 42:1-17 The victory of the Muslims was foretold in Bible.


Why does Isaiah (42:11) speaks about the rejoicing of the inhabitants of Ishmael's son Kedar who lived in Medina ⁉️To identify the Prophet of the Jews ⁉️ ""A light for the Gentiles (Non-Jews)”(42:6).


Yes, Isaiah 60:7 talks about the Islamic sacrifices by the sons of Ishmael (peace be upon him). And the rising of the Final prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) of Bible (Read Isaiah 42:1-13) from Medina (See 42:11).



Because the Arabia shall Rejoice by His coming. Moving to Isaiah 42:11, we see that prophecy gives 2 special places; Kedar and Sela: 📖 Isaiah 42:11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

The Old Testament scholar Charles Foster also identifies the the ""Land of Kedar"" with ‘Hedjaz’ which is Western Saudi Arabia including its famous cities of Makkah and Madina. [Charles Foster, The historical geography of Arabia, P. 130]

Yes, 📖 Isaiah 42:11 prophecies that this Arabian Messenger will migrate to Medina (Biblical Midian where Prophet Moses also migrated...) And people of Sela in Medina will sing for joy to welcome the true Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) of the Bible.

Yes, Isaiah 42:11 hints that This righteous Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) will rise from the  Land of Ishmael's son Ke'dar who used to lived in Medina to eliminate falsehood and spread justice ⚖️ throughout the world 🌍.


Yes, Isaiah 42 Verse 11 connects that awaited one with the descendants of Kedar. Who is Kedar? According to Genesis 25:13, Kedar was the second son of Ishmael, the grandfather of the Arab nation, the ancestor of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).

One of the earliest biographies of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d (d. 845 CE), documents one of the chains of genealogy, which confirms that the Prophet was a direct descendant of Ishmael through his second son Kedar. 

Hayden’s Bible dictionary states: Mohammad is said to have been of the Bene-Kedar [sons of Kedar] [A Bible Dictionary, Hayden Series, edited by Rev. Charles Boutell, p. 386].


The righteous mission of establishing justice on earth will require special help from GOD, which is conveyed by the figurative words “And will hold Your hand”. Once “GOD holds the hand of anyone”, it is impossible to defeat that person. GOD uses that person as an instrument to wipe out evil and manifest His judgement on evil doers. 


📖 Isaiah 42:4- He will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.



Notice that 📖 Isaiah 42:4 states that the islands will put their hope in his law, implying he will bring forth something new, something different, as the Law of Moses already existed at the time Isaiah made this prophecy. Another point is that the islands aresaid to put their hope in his new Torah in the future tense, again implying it is a new law and therefore can’t be a reference to the Torah of Moses which already existed at the time that Isaiah made this prophecy.

Yes, 📖 Isaiah 42:21 also stated that the God of Bible would magnify the Law to make people righteous. It hints about Al-Quran, Shariah Law.

One who will be a “light for the Gentiles (non-jews/non-christians)” (📖 Isaiah 42:6), will “open eyes that are blind” and “free people from darkness” (📖 Isaiah 42:7) of idols worships.


📖 Isaiah 42:8- I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols. 


📖 Isaiah 42:9 See, the former things have taken place, and new things (Al-Quran, Shariah law) I (God) declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.

“Paraclete” (Ahmad/Praised one) that Easa Messiah foretold to come after him was described as one who “shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear (from God through angel), that shall he speak . . .(John 16:13)

📖 Isaiah 42:10- ""Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them."" 

Isaiah informs us that this special person will bring something new. The statement “a new song” means a new way of worship. This is exactly what Islam represents. The emphasis on the new song here is singing the praise of GOD all over the earth. The Qur’an opens with the statement “Praise be to GOD, LORD of the worlds” and is recited by Muslims all over the world during prayers every day.


📖 Isaiah 42:12- Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim his praise in the islands. This seems to indicate that this special person’s impact will be far reaching.

Islam spread rapidly throughout the Arabian peninsula, even reaching as far as Spain in just over a hundred years after Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).

The law of Islam spread as far east as northern China and as far west as southern France. In fact many isles did wait for his law and when the Islamic law came to them with the Muslim armies, they welcomed their liberators. This happened in Syria, Egypt and Spain. With the advent of Islam all the oppressive powers surrounding Arabia fell one after another and the masses could live in peace from then on. In the Qur’an GOD commanded the Muslims to go on a rescue mission.

Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) wrote letters to the kings of the different lands, calling them to Islaam; so this shows that he was a Messenger sent to the whole of the people of the earth.  And he was commanded with fighting jihaad until the people entered into Islaam; so this shows that his Messengership `alayhis–salaatu was-salaam was universal.



📖 42:13- The Lord will march out like a champion, like a warrior and will triumph over his enemies. Let us see how the Qur’an confirms this in the battle of Badr when around 300 ill-armed Muslims faced a thousand strong army of the pagans to wipe out evil and manifest His judgment on evil doers. 📖 Al-Quran ch 8 verses 17-19 


📖 I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. But those who trust in idols, who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’ will be turned back in utter shame. [Isaiah 42:16-17]


Throughout 📖 Isaiah 42 there is the theme of idolatry, describing those who worship idols as “blind” and being in “darkness”. It is also said that the idolaters will be “turned back in utter shame (📖 Isaiah 42:17)


This  is unlikely to be a reference to Jesus Christ because, unlike the final Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) whose lifetime opponents were primarily idol worshippers, Jesus’ opponents during his ministry were the Jewish religious leaders, the Sadducees and Pharisees.

His people, the Israelites, were monotheists and not idol worshippers. On one occasion Jesus Christ even told his disciples to stay away from the idol worshipping Gentiles, the exact opposite of what Isaiah prophesied. The Gospel of Matthew tells us that: 📖 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: ‘Do not go among the Gentiles…[Matthew 10:5]


While 📖 Isaiah 42: 6 clearly said that The God of Bible would make this righteous servant Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) a Light for the gentiles and a covenant for the people to bring justice to the Nations (Isaiah 42:1) with the new Shariah law (Isaiah 42:4, 42:21) prescribed by the God of Bible",@Fear_ALLAH_and_speak_the_Truth,0,1747267200,False,

You could imagine how difficult it would be to survive this way. I never talked to my father .He is no more in this world now. I have not got any cousins or males around me . I never went out of the house alone ever and i know nothing about basic things. I look like a kid but my age is 30 plus now. So i actually never went to mosque to offer eid or friday prayers too ever as it is also outside the house. I never went to the barber for my haircut.  Now it was my strong wish to go and offer eid prayers but i cant go alone its not in my hands. So i wanted a friend from my country who could accompany me to mosque and guide me . See i dont go outside stays indoors ..what could i do? I messaged bearded men considering them pious on facebook i messaged alot of men asking for this small innocent help i wanted to set things right as soon as possible.

Majority of them had to say : nobody could help you start going on a walk. When i already clarified i take my mother with for my haircut what is the point of advising foolish suggestions. And few said you may go to psychologist i made them clear that i am mentally perfect belong to a decent family its just because i never had the chance to interact with any male. My father never took me anywhere. He was himself an introvert probably.  Now pakistani muslims disappointed me alot. I was never expecting them the way they turned out to be. I can be considered like a foreigner living in pakistan unaware and ignorant of things. 
Now i am hopeless 
I just want to know from muslims living in other countries if they would have helped me if i was a part of their country? 
I am teary eyed. i want to know what other muslims fellows would do in this situation . Would your reaction be the same as pakistanis or different. Would you add me in your lives and accompany me to offer prayers which is my strongest wish.",@anintrovert555,0,1747353600,False,

On the other hand, the Pakistan Army and Pakistani people took revenge on India for the atrocities committed in Gaza in the form of anger.We Pakistanis know only one thing, we have been sent by Allah and to Allah we have to return, that is why we have the best weapons and a well-organized army, we have no desire for a luxurious life and our faith is in the life after martyrdom.Allah has set a time for everything, and the time is not far when both Israel and India will be destroyed, Insha Allah.🇵🇰❣️

Ugxr58WAqilvRHCPgR14AaABAg,"Mate, a bit more research before putting out a video next time. Please check your facts...you put out this video without really checking things through...there are errors throughout...for example: Mai Kolachi was supposedly a tribal matriarch in ancient times. There is no goddess by that name. Also, Maj Gaurav Arya was just that, a Major... not a General. And there's a very good reason why a man like that never made it beyond the rank of Major: an incompetent cowardly nutjob who would get all his mates killed while he ran to save himself. The military professionals on both sides of the border do have a certain level of professional respect for each other despite the occasional trash talking. They have the same origins, and generally high levels of professionalism. And people like Gaurav are normally outcasts in top professional military circles. The cool headed professionals are cold, professional and calculated don't want clowns like Gaurav Arya around.

Also, you've been sleeping on what China's been up to the past 20 years in tech and scientific advancements. Do some research, pay a visit, and have your mind blown the moment you land at the airport. Fun fact: Apple is slowly moving production out of China for geopolitical reasons, but its upcoming 20th anniversary iPhone would still have to be built there because it cannot find anywhere else with that level of precision manufacturing capability anywhere else in the world and all in one place that can produce at that volume, on time and within budget.",@stk021,0,1747353600,False,

The Arabs derived technical guidance in every branch of study such as astronomy, mathematics and physics from India. A noted scholar of history, W.H. Siddiqui notes:

“The Arab civilization grew up intensively as well as extensively on the riches of Indian trade and commerce. Nomadic Arab tribes became partially settled communities and some of them lived within walled towns practised agriculture and commerce, wroteon wood and stone, feared the gods and honored the kings.”

Arabic medicine was founded on the translations from the Sanskrit treatise, made by command of the Kaliphs of Baghdad, 750-960 AD.

UgziIRStZ3GZnghE7ZF4AaABAg,"Dear all, let me reveal a strange fact today.

Few days ago a large majority of Indian nation was cursing and abusing Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. They tried to dig his grave; in India they curse Muslims as sons of Aurangzeb and sons of Babur.
Today, see how history repeated itself and how it slapped the face of these extremists : Pakistan Air Chief Marshal is Zaheer Ahmed Babur and Air Vice Marshal is Auranzeb. In other words Aurangzeb and Babur again attacked India and defeated them in battle. History repeated itself.
It’s a new normal created after few hundred years. Now someone tell Modi Ji that instead of accepting ceasefire, tell someone to take a Rafael and enter in Pakistan air space. The only honour left with IAF is that “None of their pilot is in Pakistan Custody “. This is a new normal.
Now Modi ji needs another few hundred years so that this Aurangzeb dies and some motivated lot fight for his grave again. And then a new Aurangzeb will emerge again. A new Babur will emerge again. This is a new normal.
Few days ago the philosophy was that “we will not talk to Pakistan and we will punish Pakistan “, today Modi says “ Baat ho gi to terro*ism per ho gi ya PoK Kashmir per ho gi” . This u turn of Modi ji from Punishment style to “Baat ho gi to ….” Style; is off course a new normal.
Indeed last few days saw many new normals.",@smaniz721,0,1747180800,False,

Unfortunately all military force that India has is the national military and no terrorist agencies; so, it either has to tolerate terrorist attacks in its soil or has to stand up and fight just to be hated by international media. It’s a lose-lose situation.

UgxRv2EyMl25ERoU0lB4AaABAg,"To those asking why Afghans support India 🇮🇳 over Pakistan 🇵🇰 in times of conflict, let me make this clear: our issue is not with the people of Pakistan, but with the Pakistani military and political establishment which for decades has acted as an enemy to the Afghan nation, despite pretending to be a “Muslim neighbor.”

Let’s look at history and facts:
	1.	Sanctuary for destruction: After 9/11, it was Pakistan that gave military bases to the United States to launch airstrikes on Afghanistan, leading to the death of over 1 million innocent Afghans. While Afghans were burning under bombs, Pakistan was earning dollars in return.
	2.	Safe haven for terrorism: The Pakistani military openly harbored and supported the Taliban and other extremist groups who killed our teachers, our doctors, our children, and destroyed our progress. Even Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, not Kabul.
	3.	Strategic depth policy: Pakistan has treated Afghanistan as its “backyard” under its evil “strategic depth” doctrine, creating instability and chaos so that Afghanistan could never stand on its feet.
	4.	Violation of Islamic brotherhood: Islam teaches us not to betray your neighbor and not to support oppressors. The Qur’an says: “Do not incline toward the oppressors, lest you be touched by the Fire…” (Surah Hud, 11:113). What Pakistan did to Afghanistan is nothing but betrayal and oppression—from supporting the Taliban to sending spies, bombs, and fake peace.
	5.	Durand Line oppression: They are still fencing the illegal Durand Line, dividing Afghan families, and killing innocent Afghans with cross-border shelling—even as we extend the hand of peace.

So yes, many Afghans support India—not because India is perfect or because we are against Muslims, but because India has never sent suicide bombers to our mosques, never funded terrorists against us, and never tried to enslave our nation through proxy war.

Until the Pakistani establishment stops treating Afghanistan as its colony and stops exporting terror in the name of Islam, the Afghan people will stand with those who respect our sovereignty, whether they are Muslim or not.",@Abdullah_tee,0,1747180800,False,

UgwhV7Hcamn0NmehsWl4AaABAg,"As an Afghan, it's important to understand why some Afghans choose to support India — not necessarily out of loyalty or admiration, but because of the long and troubled history with Pakistan. For decades, Pakistan has maintained a hostile stance toward Afghanistan, from political interference to carrying out airstrikes on Afghan soil. Given that history, it's understandable that some Afghans would align themselves with countries that oppose Pakistan. It’s not always about supporting India itself — sometimes, it’s simply about standing against a country that has caused harm to ours.

However, many people overlook the reality of India’s rising nationalism and how it affects its own Muslim population. The treatment of Muslims in India under its current political leadership is deeply concerning and shouldn’t be ignored or excused.

Personally, I believe in standing with our fellow Muslim neighbors and promoting unity rather than division. That said, supporting our neighbors doesn't mean blindly backing governments — especially not the Pakistani government, which has its own issues and history of harming Afghanistan.

UgyLnWLz8zidySkl9Px4AaABAg,"Once again, biased narratives are being pushed to defame India by falsely accusing it of engaging in forced religious domination of Hinduism. Let’s set the record straight: India’s Constitution guarantees freedom of religion (Article 25), and conversion—when it happens—is typically voluntary, driven by social, economic, or spiritual factors.

On the other hand, it’s important to note that extremist Islamist ideologies have long promoted the idea of global dominance under Sunni & Sharia law. Groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda openly declared 'convert or die' as part of their mission, falsely using Islamic scripture to justify violence. However, their views are rejected by the majority of peaceful Muslims worldwide.

Accusing India of what radical Islamists have actually practiced is not just hypocritical—it’s dangerous disinformation.

The Ottomans didn’t get “accepted”—they conquered Arab lands after defeating the Mamluks in 1517. That’s not unity; that’s empire.

Also, claiming the Ottomans only turned nationalist in the late 1800s ignores the rise of Arab nationalism around the same time—ironically, as a reaction to Turkish centralization.

When they bombed Pashtuns their excuse is that it was because of the TTP so they had to take action, but when India kills innocent Pakistanis, Pakistan takes 10 business days to respond and somehow Pakistan pulls of an operation only targeting military personnel, Pakistan treats Pashtuns like they are expendable almost like Isreal treats the Palestinians. Pakistan trained terrorist as they said from their own mouths and now those terrorists attack them but it’s innocent Pashtuns and afghans who have to deal with the aftermath of your countries choices and they did all of this because they were getting money from America to do this.

At the end of the day many afghans have disliked what Pakistan have done to them but when talking about supporting Muslims over kafirs then afghans would always support Muslims why would they support kafirs maybe they don’t support the Pakistani army but they definitely do support the Muslims, i do support Pakistan and I feel very sad for those innocents India has killed as they clearly have nothing to do with this war, even other afghans I have spoken to also have said they support Pakistan.

اس نفرت کے محرکات کیا ہیں؟ ووٹ چوری، آئین شکنی، معاشی قبضہ، صوبائی وسائل پہ قبضہ، چوروں کی حکومتیں مسلط کرنا، بلوچستان اور قبائلی پٹی میں بندوق کے زور پہ بدمعاشی، ہر ادارے پہ ریٹائرڈ/حاضر سروس جرنیلوں اور ٹاؤٹس کی تعیناتی، عمران خان کی قید، خواتین کی تضحیک، عدالتوں کی بے توقیری، اپنے دلالوں سے قوم کو دھمکیاں، 26 نومبر کا قتلِ عام اور علی ہذالقیاس۔ 

کیا پچھلے سات دنوں کے واقعات نے اوپر بیان کردہ تلخ حقائق کو بدل دیا ہے؟ کیا فوج نے آٹھ فروری کے مینڈیٹ کو تسلیم کرلیا ہے؟ کیا فوج نے SIFC کو ختم کر کے صوبوں کے وسائل ہڑپ کرنا چھوڑ دیا ہے؟ کیا فوج نے اپنے چھبیس نومبر کے قتلِ عام کی معافی مانگ لی ہے؟ کیا فوج نے عمران خان کو رہا کردیا ہے؟ کیا فوج نے یاسمین راشد، ماہرنگ بلوچ اور صنم جاوید کو رہا کردیا ہے؟ کیا فوج نے سپریم کورٹ اور اسلام آباد ہایئکورٹ میں مداخلت چھوڑ دی ہے؟ کیا فوج نے NADRA, WAPDA, FPSC, FIA, ANF, PTDC, PTA اور دیگر اداروں سے اپنے نالائق جرنیلوں کو ہٹا دیا ہے؟

 جواب ہے ""نہیں""۔ 

اسلئے نتیجہ یہ ہے کہ فوجی جرنیل آج بھی غیرمقبول ہیں۔ رہی بات ان قلمی دلالوں اور میڈیائی طوائفوں کی جنکے سر پر یہ بیانیہ بنایا جارہا ہے کہ عاصم منیر ہیرو بن گیا ہے، انہی دلالوں اور طوائفوں نے پیشنگوئیاں کر رکھی تھیں کہ نواز شریف سادہ الثریت لے گا، دوسری بڑی جماعت پیپلزپارٹی ہو گی اور عمران خان ختم شد۔ حقیقت کیا تھی اس دہرانے کی ضرورت نہیں۔ باقی اگر عاصم منیر کو عوامی مقبولیت کا زعم ہے تو یہ آج الیکشن کروا کے دیکھ لے، جو اسکے سسر نواز شریف کے ساتھ ہوا تھا وہی اسکے ساتھ ہوگا۔",@Baaji-jd4mj,0,1747180800,False,

UgwcXWJ4PftEghwdzuB4AaABAg,"The ideas of Akhand Bharat and the Greater Israel project are both expansionist-nationalist visions rooted in historical, religious, and cultural claims. While these concepts are not official state policies (and are often denied by governments), they are promoted by ideological groups tied to Hindutva in India and Zionism in Israel, especially in their far-right expressions.

Here’s a breakdown of the similarities between Akhand Bharat and Greater Israel:

1. Ideological Roots in Religious Nationalism

Akhand Bharat is a Hindutva vision of a united “undivided India” that includes modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet.

Greater Israel is a vision drawn from biblical and religious Zionism, claiming land from the Nile to the Euphrates, which could include parts of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and the Palestinian territories.

Similarity: Both envision a revival of a mythologized ancient or religious homeland, to restore national or religious glory.

2. Revisionist Historical Narratives

Akhand Bharat claims that the Indian subcontinent was once a unified Hindu civilization before foreign (especially Muslim and British) invasions.

Greater Israel draws on biblical claims of the land promised to the Israelites by God.

Similarity: Both rely on mythological or ancient historical narratives to legitimize modern political ideologies.

3. Ethnic and Religious Exclusivism

Hindutva envisions India as a Hindu-first nation, with other religions tolerated only if they accept Hindu cultural dominance.

Zionism, especially in its extreme forms, sees Israel as a Jewish homeland, with increasing calls to exclude or subjugate Palestinians.

Similarity: Both ideologies, at their extremes, support ethnoreligious homogeneity and view minorities as demographic or ideological threats.

4. Justification of Settlements and Occupation

Zionists have built Jewish settlements in the West Bank, considered illegal under international law, to “reclaim” ancestral lands.

Hindutva groups support demographic and legal changes in Kashmir (post-Article 370) and the Northeast to “integrate” them into Hindu India.

Similarity: Strategic settlement and demographic engineering to change the character of contested or minority regions.

5. Role of Militant Ideologies

Akhand Bharat is promoted by the RSS and Sangh Parivar, which operate grassroots and paramilitary networks.

Greater Israel has been pushed by settler movements, Kahanist factions, and right-wing Zionist parties.

Similarity: Both are driven by ideologically hardline, often violent groups operating outside formal politics, but with close ties to ruling parties.

6. Political Denial vs. Ideological Reality

Indian leaders often distance themselves from Akhand Bharat publicly, but imagery (like murals in Parliament) and rhetoric suggest otherwise.

Israeli governments officially reject Greater Israel, but settlement expansion and annexation policies align with it in practice.

Similarity: Both concepts are denied diplomatically but promoted ideologically, often through education, propaganda, or symbolism.

7. Perception of Civilizational Conflict

Akhand Bharat portrays Hindus as under siege from centuries of Muslim and colonial rule.

Greater Israel frames Jewish survival as dependent on dominance in a hostile Arab world.

Similarity: Both see themselves as civilizations under existential threat, justifying territorial expansion as self-defense or revival.

8. Diaspora Support

Hindu nationalist groups in the U.S., U.K., and Canada fund and promote the Akhand Bharat idea.

Pro-Zionist lobbies and Christian evangelicals support Greater Israel in the U.S. and Europe.

Similarity: Both visions receive significant ideological and financial backing from diasporas.

Conclusion

Akhand Bharat and the Greater Israel project are two ideological visions rooted in religious nationalism, territorial expansion, and historical revisionism. While not formal state policies, they deeply influence domestic politics, foreign policy postures, and attitudes toward minorities.

They represent a broader global trend of ethno-nationalist expansionism, which challenges secularism, pluralism, and international norms — with real consequences for peace and stability in their respective regions.",@ataukazamana,0,1747180800,False,
