collaboration between India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya (NPOM).

The core technology is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks (Yakhont) missile, which provided the ramjet propulsion system and basic design framework. Russia contributed significantly to the missile’s propulsion, guidance, and seeker systems. However, India played a critical role in adapting and enhancing the missile, integrating indigenous subsystems like the fire control system, onboard electronics, and software. India also developed variants for different platforms (land, sea, air, and submarine).

So, while the BrahMos leverages Russian foundational tech, it’s a co-developed system with substantial Indian input, making it a hybrid of both nations’ expertise. Calling it solely Russian would be inaccurate.",@vst1610,6,1747598400,True,UgyOeL8EOFToC7AYzVJ4AaABAg

That part isn’t flashy, but it’s just as impressive. India relied on a mix of Russian and domestically developed air defense systems to intercept incoming threats — and they worked.

Now, regarding the terror attacks: I firmly believe these were planned and launched from Pakistani soil. It’s possible that Pakistan has lost control over some of the militant groups operating there, but that doesn’t absolve them. If you raise a dog in your home and it runs into your neighbor’s yard and bites them, you’re still responsible. The U.S. recognized this long ago and pressured Pakistan to either control or eliminate these groups.

Even if India lost two or three jets in the conflict, I’d still say India came out ahead. The strategic message was clear, the retaliation was disciplined, and the defense was solid.",@The_Viking970,5,1747594800,False,

And 'Pakistan accepting loss' as when India has irrefutable satellite images of damages as proof and leaves Pakistan with no choice but to accept it. 
Pakistan and the entire world has access to satellite images which they can use to prove all their tall claims of damages. It's not upto India to prove the absence of what Pakistan claims as proving a negative is a logical fallacy. But it's upto Pakistan to provide evidence and accurately time stamped satellite images to prove their claims of damages (not misrepresentation of only after images of supposed damage when in actuality that was an already undergoing renovation work before the incident, like in Udhampur). India only has to point out the lack of authenticity of such claims. 
What Pakistan is not accepting, is that India's 3 tiered air defense system, worked perfectly to detect almost every drone and all the missles they sent to protected military targets. The one or two drones that got in where targeted on civilian location and not protected military targets, which is why they cannot use satellite images of those either as evidence to prove that a few of their drones in the swarm got through, because then it would be proof of Pakistan escalating by attacking civilians. 
All the civilian videos from Indian side are showing Pakistani drones getting neutralized, missiles getting intercepted by Indian air defense system perfectly and only shows damages from Pakistani cross border shelling at tiny homes in the border. Meanwhile, the civilian videos from Pakistan are all clearly showing missiles and explosives clearly landing, with the sound and visuals of explosion on impact. 
The world didn't know of Pakistan's damages when they 'accepted it', but when India proved to the world that their targets where all infrasturcture for deterance and not personnel oriented for escalation.
Pakistan cannot do the same because their targets would either prove themselves to have done escalatory attacks or their clear disadvantage since they do not have an indegenous satellite navigation system for preprogrammed targets",@aleenaprasannan2146,1,1747594800,True,UgwPPrrxSPXXdbIMwKx4AaABAg

UgyxaoTzUBC0Bn55MWx4AaABAg,"India–Pakistan Conflict, May 2025: Refined Summary
The war between India and Pakistan in May 2025 was sparked by a terrorist attack on April 22 in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26–27 people, predominantly Hindu tourists. The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Indian authorities claim that they were unable to immediately apprehend the perpetrators due to a combination of challenging terrain, sophisticated planning, cross-border involvement, and the attackers’ ability to blend into local networks.

India officially accused the Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency, the ISI, of orchestrating the attack. Pakistan denied involvement, requested evidence, and expressed willingness to support an investigation. India, however, argued that providing further evidence would be futile, citing past incidents such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks, where substantial proof failed to result in meaningful action by Pakistan. Unfortunately, Pakistan’s history includes both being a victim of terrorism and facing longstanding allegations of supporting or sponsoring militant groups abroad. Notably, the world’s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, was found and killed by U.S. forces in 2011 while hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan, just a short distance from the country’s premier military academy

On May 7, 2025, India launched Operation Sindoor, a series of air and missile strikes targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. According to Indian sources, nine locations linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba were targeted between 1:05 and 1:30 a.m. IST. Pakistan, however, claimed that the strikes hit civilian areas and religious sites, resulting in the deaths of innocent civilians, including women and children.

A significant development following the strikes was the presence of Hafiz Abdur Rauf, a senior Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and US-designated global terrorist, leading funeral prayers for those killed at Muridke. India cited this, along with satellite imagery and other evidence, as compelling proof that its strikes were directed at terror infrastructure rather than civilian populations.

Key Outcomes
Military Impact: India inflicted considerable damage on several Pakistani airbases, substantiating its claims with satellite imagery from independent sources. These actions demonstrated India’s advanced missile and precision strike capabilities, and its decision not to escalate further highlighted strategic restraint.

Air Combat Claims: India claimed to have shot down Pakistani jets, though no conclusive evidence was presented. The Pakistan Air Force asserted it had downed three Rafales and three other Indian jets; however, independent experts and French media suggest that only one Rafale was likely lost, supported by wreckage found on the Indian side.

Drone Warfare: Pakistan claimed to have neutralized Indian drones that penetrated deep into its territory, but these incursions exposed gaps in Pakistan’s counter-drone defenses.

Disputed Damage: Pakistan’s assertions of successful strikes on Indian bases were contradicted by satellite imagery, which showed no significant damage.

Strategic Recommendations
For India: There is a clear need to further enhance combat strategy, and expand domestic production capabilities for advanced aircraft.

For Pakistan: Upgrading air defense systems with Chinese assistance-and investing in indigenous manufacturing should be prioritized, especially given Pakistan’s reliance on external financial support from World banks and IMF. Strengthening counter-drone measures is also essential.",@detector-n7x,1,1747594800,False,

-Palestine-sympathiser echo chamber simply hates Indians— for being pro-Israel and proud Kafir.

They’re never going to report it truthfully, and the same with Chinese news. In that article, one author is Mujib Marshal, a Muslim from Afghanistan. The other one is Agnes Chang from China.

We hit Pakistan so hard that it went running to its daddy and asked for a ceasefire, which they themselves broke after 3 hours.

The whole point of why countries use proxies is “plausible deniability.” It’s not just one attack. Pakistan has done dozens of attacks before this. In 26/11, we caught one guy alive, and he was Pakistani.

The Indian Air Force has released many more satellite photos. Why didn’t you post all of them? 

America has destroyed countries without any evidence. Osama saying he did it is not evidence, and phone calls could be doctored. But USA still went and occupied a country for 20 years. And why aren’t you asking Pakistan a question that If they weren’t responsible for the attack, why did they decide to attack back? why they fighting for extremist ? designated Extremists were at the funeral. 

And who cares if jets went down? What matters is, have they done the job? Which they sure did.

Why didn’t they rebuild their hangars or order new-hq9 radars to replace those destroyed, if everything could indeed be fixed in hours? Why is your government issuing tenders for rebuilding airbases now and runways, while no such tenders have been passed in India for any airbase or runway repair? You claim these can be fixed in hours, yet newly patched areas on runways or airbases would visibly stand out, and satellite images have shown no such changes in Udhampur air base . Additionally, your army claimed to have destroyed the Udhampur airbase and the S-400 system, although they didn’t explicitly mention destroying the S-400. However, the March 12 satellite images showed entire Udhampur airbase intact, with no visible damage in the area where the S-400 system is deployed, indicating that nothing came close to the base if something struck it would have been visible as mark on that place in satellite image.

Furthermore, during Minister Modi's full tour of the base, the engagement radar was visibly present beside the launch vehicle. In high-quality air defense systems like the S-400 and Patriot air defense system, the long-range radar is typically deployed kilometers away from other components to detect threats more effectively. As for the command vehicle of the S-400, which is its main component, it is the most guarded and is only visible and deployed during imminent threats as it remained active even after the so-called ceasefire agreement which Pakistan violated by your army within hours by launching drones and missiles. Despite the conflict ending as per the ceasefire, Udhampur’s S-400 system became active, neutralizing incoming projectiles, a task impossible without the command vehicle and long-range radar in operation. It took Ukraine all the financial ,military and geopolitical support from USA and whole Europe to destroy a single S400 that too after a year of conflict and your lumber 1 army claims they destroyed it with center of gravity and no proof  precent ...",@Me_1andOnly_Me,0,1747602000,True,Ugw-xh9XFcTADVD7Et94AaABAg

UgwPgbhl-efuEw6hZCp4AaABAg,"Based on the *Martin-Baker ejection seat logs* and detailed screenshots, here's the **critical conclusion**:

---

### ✅ *Only One Plausible Rafale Loss (Possibly #7787)*

* **Ejection Notices from #7784 to #7789**:

  * \#7784 – Mirage V (Pakistan)
  * \#7786 – Mk10, unknown aircraft (not Rafale)
  * \#7788 – US Navy F/A-18F
  * \#7789 – Finnish F/A-18C
* *All accounted and non-Rafale*
* The *only missing log is #7787*

---

### 🔍 *Inference*

* Rafale jets use the *Martin-Baker Mk16F* seat.
* If a **Rafale ejection happened**, it would likely be recorded as a unique entry.
* Since **#7787 is not visible**, it’s the **only entry that could potentially represent a Rafale ejection**—**but**:

  * There is *no confirmation* from Martin-Baker.
  * There is *no official statement* from the Indian Air Force.
  * The *IAF maintains that all pilots are safe* and accounted for.

---

### 🧭 *Conclusion*

* *Only one possible Rafale loss* can be speculated, corresponding to **unlisted ejection #7787**.
* However, **in absence of aircraft model, seat type, or country details**, this remains **unconfirmed and speculative**.

Maybe because India has only had independence and sovereignty to develop their own technology for just 77 years now, unlike China who has had, I don't know, forever to develop their own indegenous technology? And they also were not systematically deindustrialized by a foreign colonial country for 200 years either? 
India might not have developed their 5th gen jets at the same time as China, because China and India is two different nations with different priorities for indegenisation of technology? China has always been an expansionist entity since its inception, so there is no surprise that it will priorities it's funding on developing the latest tech for ariel offensive capabilities. 
While India is a democracy, which has to prioritize rebuilding from scratch, prioritizing development of indigenous technologies that are multipurpose, inclusive, people centric and also leapfrog and catch up when it was denied access to the wealth and progress of industrial revolution. 
China and India are two different countries, with different geographical advantages and disadvantages and different military objectives. Then why would India have the same priorities S China?

The effects of cruise missiles on Pakistan's thin geography are known and about what was expected. Still, it doesn't really change the balance of power here. Fact is, Pakistan won the air fight and its looking more and more likely that a Chinese missile took out an s-400 too. 

Given that, the current state is that India can attack Pakistan with its more advanced missiles, but Pakistan can turn section of India into Iraq with its air force. Comes down to whether India can damage enough air bases with missile strikes before the airframes go up.


Then there's the role of drones in all this - the HQ9's were overwhelmed in the same way the S -400's were in Ukraine. Drone mob to screen the missiles. It's true that Pakistan had to shut down its radars to protect them from drones (1 claimed + confirmed radar loss), but its also true that very many HAROP drones were taken out, some in very good condition.

It should be clear that India is going to have to find an answer to the range on the Chinese missiles to protect its air craft and air defenses. At the same time, its very likely that Pakistan is going to get alot more air defense and drone specific defense.

Overall, the situation is very much against India - you have to remember that ALL its neighbors have an axe to grind.

Imagine that. So, next time when Israel's air defence system fails to intercept a Houthi missile or a Hamas rocket, will we see a post titled 'The Houthis Beat Israel's Air Defence?'. I really doubt it....😁

Maybe we shoud all ask this question: If the Pakistanis claim that they have downed three Indian Rafaels, all India has to do is give proof that they have all the Rafaels intact and accounted for in their Air Force. Clear all the 'fog' and 'ambuigities' once and for all, and in so doing prove Pakistan wrong in front of the whole world. So, why aren't they doing that? They are always so desperate and eager to prove Pakistan is a terroritst country, a liar. So, why not avail this golden oppurtunity to prove Pakistan is in fact a liar? Perhaps because Pakistan did down their jets as they claim....which is what compared to some Indian missles making it through the Pakistani Air Defence system,???

What should be, and in fact is, far more worrisome and problematic for India is that they cannot bully a country 6 times smaller in population and 4 times in area. Pakistan standing up to India and then defeating them, while being a much smaller country and lacking resources compared to India and also getting a lot more criticism as compared to India getting a lot more favouritism on the world stage, is nothing short of being heroic and couragerous. 😉

Modern air warfare is absolutely nothing like air warfare even in the 90s or early oughties.

CHICAGO—A Pakistani native who operated a Chicago-based immigration business was sentenced today to 14 years in prison for conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist plot in Denmark and providing material support to Lashkar e Tayyiba, a terrorist organization operating in Pakistan that was responsible for the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India. The defendant, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, was convicted of the charges on June 9, 2011, following a three-week trial in U.S. District Court in Chicago.

Rana, 52, a Canadian citizen, was ordered to serve 14 years, followed by five years of supervised release, by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber. “This certainly was a dastardly plot,” Judge Leinenweber said in imposing the sentence.
This person is in an Indian jail now.

Despite this, the Air Force has shown effective performance, unlike the Army, which faces long-standing criticism for underperformance, interference in politics and a focus on commercial ventures such as luxury housing schemes.  Notably, Pakistan lacks advanced programs like supersonic or hypersonic cruise missiles, and the Army failed to provide satellite evidence of precision strikes on India, leaving only the Air Force to demonstrate tangible results with limited resources.

Just think about how American or chinese hypes their defence equipments when they do such things and play the business of wars. Pakistan drones( from china or turkey or USA or wherever they get their defence equipments) didn't work much and were neutralised seen even in certified videos . The only thing which really worked was shelling( low height warfare which depends on terrain)  by Pakistan towards India  which are impossible for anyone to stop if you look at the geography and time taken to prepare for such attacks which need some substantial reaction time to respond for anyone and everyone and thus also highlights the Pakistan's intention to kill even civilians ( near bordering areas) without any due process and their insecure nature if they were hit deep. India follows no first use policy for nuclear weapons while their non elected officials ( Pakistan army generals and stupid politicians) flaunt their nuclear weapons. This is literally threatening the world that they are going to show the world the calamity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki again if they( Pakistani military) will not get cheap money from the world just like how they wanted in soviet afghan war. Would you want a neighbour like Pakistan where civilian government is changed according to military whims and people are openly carrying weapons on their streets. I will accept that India isn't some saint but their defence wings are atleast responsible when they acquire such power . This is something which people are overlooking in this conflict. See what Americans did to middle East when they were hit with 9/11 . See what israel did when heinous act was done on October 7. But Indian defence forces did something which was mature and non-escalotory in nature. I think it's something which suggests how military superpowers should act even when something heinous is done on Indian soil( Pahalgam terror attack ) while the official account of Pakistan military wings were using game footage. Give me one aspect of Pakistan military or defence forces which you like in this whole shitshow. I am sure after this fog of war settles down whole world will see what is really wrong with Pakistan.

UgzO0Yf7HCO_YeUoymJ4AaABAg,The inherent weakness of missiles is that airbases are pretty large and stockpiles are limited. Even a military juggernaut like Russia has not been able to produce and shoot enough PGMs at Ukrainian airbases to cripple the Ukr Air force. Pakistan due to its history largely folllows the Western doctrine of creating air superiority with jets and focuses less on air defense. Pakistan has demonstrated its technological superiority in a head-to-head BVR scenario and is expected to dominate the skies in a total war scenario. In these crises no side wants to for a total war and is constantly looking for off-ramps but Pakistan is now incentivised to go full tilt at the outset and take out Indian missile lanuchers to protect it airbases from attack.

The Indian Army released drone footage and photographs showing the live strikes and the resulting damage, which were independently verified through satellite imagery with many International Independent media outlets . Even Pakistan’s own DGISPR admitted that missiles hit at least three of their airbases.
Meanwhile, Pakistan couldn’t provide a single piece of video or photo evidence of any Indian aircraft being shot down or any Indian airbase being hit—let alone the S-400.

UgzklzDU8sWT9hgjz6t4AaABAg,"Its fantastic to see escalation theory being considered here.

India-Pakistan is different from Russia/Israel attacking Ukraine/Gaza respectively because both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, so rather than being an asymmetric conflict with one side having that top of the ladder, while one side might have fewer steps on their ladder, both do have that final ""game over"" button at the top. That changes the dynamics of the conflict.
So as the video points out, you want them to be able to take measured steps up the escalation ladder, and conventional disparity like this removes steps.

Nuclear weapons are not a ""winning"" weapon, but a weapon for turning a loss, into a lose lose, and therefore essentially provide a backstop for each side preventing a total loss. But you never want your enemy to be at that backstop, because then you both lose, so you want your enemy to be able to take the smallest steps possible up the escalation ladder towards the nuclear backstop, and be able to achieve your goals without reaching it.

Anyone thinking about a US-China conflict should keep this in mind. Planners on both sides probably have a very clear understanding of where each nations backstop is, and if there is a conflict, hopefully it can be resolved without a backstop being reached, The same for India - Pakistan. Neither side can have war goals beyond the backstop or they both lose.",@cica5978,0,1747594800,False,
